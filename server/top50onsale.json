There is only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected.<br><br>Your task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in mind that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again are the memories of your final mistake.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/infectedv2.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet Others</h2><br>Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert.

      "about_the_game": "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">This is your Story</h2><br>There are no map markers, daily quests, or scoreboards to help you create your story. There is only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected.<br><br>Your task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in mind that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again are the memories of your final mistake.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/infectedv2.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet Others</h2><br>Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert.

Monsters beyond your imagination, and you: The Manager. A roguelite monster-management simulation inspired by the likes of the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Order your employees to perform work with the creatures and watch as it unfolds; harness greater energy, and expand the facility. One disaster will lead to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”<br><br><strong>Lobotomy Corporation is a roguelite monster-management simulation.</strong><br><br>Our game was inspired by the monsters birthed of various inspirations featured in games, film, and series, such as the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Going further, it was developed with this thought: <i>“What if those monsters were real, and your job were to manage them?”</i><br><br>You will be playing as the Manager of Lobotomy Corporation, a company in which such creatures are contained and managed. Order your employees to perform work with and on the creatures and watch the results expectantly. Gather energy produced by the monsters and fulfill the quota each day, expand the facility, and manage even more strange beings. In this game, the player will face an ever-present sense of tension and dread as they progress through each day.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Management.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>“Our new technology will bring salvation to humanity.”</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Lobotomy Corporation is a newly established energy company that isolates Abnormalities and extracts an infinite amount of energy from them by using independently developed technology</strong>, or so it seems on the outside.

Some might dislike the idea of being locked inside a Containment Unit, and <strong>may sometimes attempt to breach containment.</strong><br><br><strong>A breaching Abnormality will attack every employee in sight and disrupt the facility’s systems.</strong> Worse still, it could open up other units and cause more Abnormalities to escape. Furthermore, employees eroded or corrupted by certain Abnormalities will have a greatly adverse influence on other employees. Employees brainwashed by Abnormalities might randomly attack those around them, wholly oblivious to what they are doing. In addition, employees may go insane from serious psychic trauma, disobeying your orders and damaging the psyche of other employees around them.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Suppression.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>One disaster leads to another, until everything has fallen into chaos.</strong></h2><br><br>If you fail to resolve a situation immediately, it will ultimately spiral out of control and throw the whole facility into chaos. When such a situation does occur, you will have to gather employees to suppress any threat and regain control of the situation, or give up parts of the facility to ensure the company’s safety.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Story1.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>“Tell me, manager.

You may have to ask questions, or answer questions from others. Here, you will uncover the secrets surrounding the company and yourself, and mayhaps even more.<br><br>“Hello, X.”<br>“I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”",

In the process of managing Abnormalities, you will gain the power of information.<br><br>The amount of energy you can acquire from Abnormalities will depend heavily on the type of work your employees perform.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Escape.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>This is NOT a tycoon.</strong></h2><br><br>As mentioned before, Abnormalities are beings that need to be treated with great care. Some might dislike the idea of being locked inside a Containment Unit, and <strong>may sometimes attempt to breach containment.</strong><br><br><strong>A breaching Abnormality will attack every employee in sight and disrupt the facility’s systems.</strong> Worse still, it could open up other units and cause more Abnormalities to escape. Furthermore, employees eroded or corrupted by certain Abnormalities will have a greatly adverse influence on other employees. Employees brainwashed by Abnormalities might randomly attack those around them, wholly oblivious to what they are doing. In addition, employees may go insane from serious psychic trauma, disobeying your orders and damaging the psyche of other employees around them.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Suppression.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>One disaster leads to another, until everything has fallen into chaos.</strong></h2><br><br>If you fail to resolve a situation immediately, it will ultimately spiral out of control and throw the whole facility into chaos. When such a situation does occur, you will have to gather employees to suppress any threat and regain control of the situation, or give up parts of the facility to ensure the company’s safety.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Story1.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>“Tell me, manager. Do you have any wishes?”</strong></h2><br><br>The game consists of two main portions: Monster Management and visual Story Segments.<br>Once a day of managing Abnormalities and producing energy ends, the story segment will follow right afterward.<br><br><strong>In the Story Segments, dialogue with Angela (the AI you’ll also be seeing occasionally in the management portion of the game) and the Sephirot will play.</strong> As you progress through the missions they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden deep in the company. You may have to ask questions, or answer questions from others. Here, you will uncover the secrets surrounding the company and yourself, and mayhaps even more.<br><br>“Hello, X.”<br>“I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”",

Some of the monsters may have human traits, but all are monsters/creatures in Nordic folklore. In addition, you will be able to see dead creatures or animals in magical forests, these create storytelling around the trolls' everyday life. Some fantasy creatures have bodies that resemble the human shape, sometimes they appear semi-nude or wearing revealing clothing."

We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what’s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it’s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems. <br><br>In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city’s technology and holds key information on all of the city’s residents.  <br><br>You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy.  Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city’s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more. <br><br>Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">KEY FEATURES</h2><br><strong>HACK THE CITY</strong><br>Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city’s infrastructure.  Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city’s CTOS can become your weapon.<br><br><strong>STREET JUSTICE</strong><br>Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation.  The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons. <br><br><strong>HIGH OCTANE DRIVING</strong><br>Ubisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game bursting with horsepower.

Fight your way across the most immersive maps yet, with many real-world locations captured in stunning detail, and an improved traversal system that lets you explore more of them than ever before.<br><br>France, 1944 – As part of a covert US Rangers operation to weaken the Atlantikwall fortifications along the coast of Brittany, elite marksman Karl Fairburne makes contact with the French Resistance. Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1029690/extras/SE5_Campaign_Final_2.gif?t=1684843035\" /><br><br><strong>EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN</strong><br>Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1029690/extras/SE5_Traversal_Final.gif?t=1684843035\" /><br><br><strong>ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL</strong><br>Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout.

Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.<br><br><strong>INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP</strong><br>Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.<br><br><strong>TENSE ADVERSARIAL MULTIPLAYER</strong><br>Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1029690/extras/SE5_Kill_Cam_Paint_Overlay.gif?t=1684843035\" /><br><br><strong>ENHANCED KILL CAM</strong><br>More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.",

Soon they uncover a secret Nazi project that threatens to end the war before the Allies can even invade Europe: Operation Kraken.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1029690/extras/SE5_Campaign_Final_2.gif?t=1684843035\" /><br><br><strong>EXPANSIVE CAMPAIGN</strong><br>Many real-world locations have been captured using photogrammetry to recreate a living, immersive environment, and multiple infiltration and extraction points and kill list targets provide a whole new perspective on each mission. Take on the Nazi plot solo or work with a partner, with improved co-op mechanics allowing you to share ammo and items, give orders and heal each other.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1029690/extras/SE5_Traversal_Final.gif?t=1684843035\" /><br><br><strong>ADVANCED GUNPLAY PHYSICS AND TRAVERSAL</strong><br>Use ziplines, slide down slopes and shimmy along ledges to reach the perfect vantage point, or to sneak past a sharp-eyed lookout. Factor in rifle stock and barrel options along with gravity, wind and heart rate while you line up your sights on the target.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1029690/extras/SE5_Weapon_Customisation_final.gif?t=1684843035\" /><br><br><strong>HIGH CALIBRE CUSTOMISATION</strong><br>Use workbenches to customise and upgrade virtually every aspect of your weapon – change scopes, stocks, barrels, magazines and more. Rifles, secondaries and pistols all have a huge variety of options. On top of that you can select the ammo to suit your target, from armour-piercing right down to non-lethal.<br><br><strong>INVASION MODE – CAMPAIGN DROP IN PvP AND CO-OP</strong><br>Invade another player’s Campaign as an Axis sniper and engage in a deadly game of cat and mouse, providing a new dimension to the challenge as you stalk your prey. Alternatively, as Karl you can call for assistance and have a second sniper drop in to help you out of a tricky situation.<br><br><strong>TENSE ADVERSARIAL MULTIPLAYER</strong><br>Customise your character and loadout and earn XP, medals and ribbons as you take on intensely competitive 16 player battles that will really test your sharpshooting skills. If co-op’s more your style, you can team up with up to 3 other players against waves of enemies in Survival mode.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1029690/extras/SE5_Kill_Cam_Paint_Overlay.gif?t=1684843035\" /><br><br><strong>ENHANCED KILL CAM</strong><br>More realistic and grisly than ever, the trademark X-ray kill cam returns, showing you the true destructive power of each shot. Bones deflect bullets unpredictably, ripping a new path through enemy bodies. SMGs and pistols can also trigger kill cams, including multiple shots in dramatic slow motion.",

In order to survive, you will need to mine raw materials from the earth, grow food, build factories, manufacture products, construct vehicles, research new technologies, explore your surroundings, and trade with other islands. If you do things right, you'll work your way up towards an industrial superpower and you can even start a space program! But this is no easy task and you will be put to the test to keep your settlement alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manufacture products</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/01_Manufacture_products.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Start simple - smelt iron, mix concrete, create construction parts, and grow food. Soon you will be able to expand into crude oil processing, electronics, solar panels, data centers, and even rockets. There are over 150 unique products to explore and work with!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build vehicles and transport products</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/02_Build_vehicles_and_transport_products.png?t=1685468315\" /><br>Logistics systems ensure that trucks will automatically deliver products where they are most needed. You can configure the logistics to make it more efficient. Don’t forget to build enough trucks or upgrade existing ones to keep things moving!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build conveyor belts and pipes</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/04_Build_your_own_transport_lines.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Use conveyor belts and pipes to route products efficiently and relieve stress on truck-based logistics. The transport system supports vertical stacking and auto-pathing for easy placement. Balancers and sorters also help organize your assembly lines by providing priority and sorting functionalities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mine raw resources on fully dynamic terrain</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/05_Mine_raw_resources_on_fully_dynamic_terrain.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Find the natural riches of your land and use them to expand your empire. Mine coal, iron, copper, gold, or pump underground oil and water! Make open-pit mines to extract valuable ores from underground, or just dump excess rocks into the ocean to create a new land to build on! Remember that no mountain is tall enough for your fleet of excavators!<br><br>Additionally, the dynamic terrain system allows you to create access to various levels of elevation throughout your island. Dig or dump terrain to create slopes between hard to reach places so that you can have the most efficient path for your vehicles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Farm your land</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/06_Farm_your_land.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>You need to feed your people by growing simple crops such as potatoes.

Build housing and provide essentials to your citizens such as food, water, electricity, healthcare, and household goods. Population will grow on its own depending on their health and happiness, but you can also recruit and rescue populations on the world map to help aid your island.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build complex oil and chemical refineries</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/08_Build_complex_oil_and_chemical_refineries.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Break crude oil down into different usable fractions using multiple refining stages.

Pick one of the beaver factions and see how long your colony can last.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beaver societies</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-1-Factions.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Control one of two beaver factions: the nature-friendly Folktails or the industrious Iron Teeth. Each faction has a unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. Choose what fits your playstyle!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wet and dry seasons</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-2-WetDry.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Prepare your settlement for recurring droughts. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">River control</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-3-RiverControl.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Beavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. Put up dams and floodgates, dig canals with explosives, and redirect rivers to bring life back to the wasteland. Just be careful with that dynamite.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lumberpunk</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-4-Lumberpunk.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Turn timber into sophisticated machinery – from water wheels and sawmills to engines and mechanized pumps. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bots</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/bots_u3.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Supercharge your colony with mechanized beavers! Power them up, maintain them, and you'll get extra efficient workers for almost any job. They will literally move mountains for you thanks to their unique ability to put up land blocks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vertical architecture</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-5-Verticality.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Create a thriving beaver settlement using a vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, construct platforms and bridges, and set up a power grid for your growing population.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Day and night cycle</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/new-day-night.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Build a multi-district city with efficient production chains and nighttime activities.

      "about_the_game": "Mankind turned Earth into a dry wasteland and perished, but some species adapted and evolved. Pick one of the beaver factions and see how long your colony can last.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beaver societies</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-1-Factions.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Control one of two beaver factions: the nature-friendly Folktails or the industrious Iron Teeth. Each faction has a unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. Choose what fits your playstyle!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wet and dry seasons</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-2-WetDry.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Prepare your settlement for recurring droughts. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">River control</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-3-RiverControl.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Beavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. Put up dams and floodgates, dig canals with explosives, and redirect rivers to bring life back to the wasteland. Just be careful with that dynamite.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lumberpunk</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-4-Lumberpunk.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Turn timber into sophisticated machinery – from water wheels and sawmills to engines and mechanized pumps. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bots</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/bots_u3.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Supercharge your colony with mechanized beavers! Power them up, maintain them, and you'll get extra efficient workers for almost any job. They will literally move mountains for you thanks to their unique ability to put up land blocks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Vertical architecture</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-5-Verticality.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Create a thriving beaver settlement using a vertical architecture system. Space is limited, so stack lodges and workshops on top of each other, construct platforms and bridges, and set up a power grid for your growing population.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Day and night cycle</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/new-day-night.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Build a multi-district city with efficient production chains and nighttime activities.

Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military strength and flexibility.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Vagabond_Button.png?t=1680196419\" /><br>The <strong>Vagabond</strong> is an adventurer to some, a trader to others, and thief to more, and an all-around scoundrel. As the Vagabond, you will explore all over the map, beyond just it's clearings, into dense woods to find items and ruins. You can trade and lend aid to the warring factions of the forest to help you complete your own secret quests.<br><br>The Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves their relationship with another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward them, the Vagabond scores victory points. You can also complete quests to score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage a pack of items, expand your selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing aid to other factions.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/RootFooter.png?t=1680196419\" />",
