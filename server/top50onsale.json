As a long time fan of the franchise, I've been waiting to see how things have changed.. And they have changed a lot (compared to GoW I, II & III). This game moves GoW from the classic \"idk, I'm stronk, hack 'n slash everyone\" to more of a \"wait hang on, I need to take some time here\" contemplative challenge. The challenges presented are the right level of difficulty to be truly rewarding when completed. \nI just have to say, as a final note... Go. W has always captured my heart in terms of the story telling aspect, and this instalment has given me the strongest emotional reaction that I've had playing through this franchise to date.\nSomehow, you (Santa Monica Studios) have made me fall in love all over again. Mad props to literally EVERY SINGLE SOUL on the production team. \nLove it.",

New Game+ added just the right amount of additional content to make it worth while (plus I couldn't get enough after one play through) \n\nAn AI definitely did not write the below review:\n\nGod of War is an absolute triumph in the world of video games. From the moment I picked up the controller, I was transported into an epic adventure unlike anything I had ever experienced. This game is a true masterpiece that raises the bar for storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and visual excellence.\n\nFirst and foremost, the narrative in God of War is an awe-inspiring achievement. The game takes us on a journey with Kratos, the Spartan warrior, as he navigates the realms of Norse mythology alongside his son, Atreus. The father-son dynamic is beautifully crafted, and their evolving relationship adds a depth of emotion and vulnerability rarely seen in video games. The writing is impeccable, weaving a rich tapestry of tragedy, growth, and redemption that will keep you emotionally invested from start to finish.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are flawless and finely tuned to perfection. Combat in God of War is intense, satisfying, and deeply strategic. Kratos wields his Leviathan Axe with unparalleled precision, while Atreus provides invaluable support with his archery skills. The seamless integration of cinematic moments into gameplay adds to the immersion, making every battle a breathtaking spectacle.\n\nThe world of God of War is a stunning work of art. The attention to detail in the environments, character designs, and mythical creatures is jaw-dropping. Exploring the realms of Norse mythology feels authentic and immersive, with each area offering unique challenges and secrets waiting to be discovered. The game seamlessly blends the epic scale of its world with intimate character-driven moments, creating a balanced and cohesive experience.\n\nFurthermore, the musical score deserves special mention. The hauntingly beautiful compositions perfectly complement the narrative and evoke a wide range of emotions. The music swells with grandeur during epic battles, and delicately underscores the quieter, introspective moments, leaving a lasting impression on players.\n\nGod of War is a shining example of what video games can achieve as an art form. It pushes boundaries, challenges conventions, and raises the bar for storytelling and gameplay. With its breathtaking visuals, emotionally charged narrative, and meticulously crafted gameplay mechanics, it has set a new standard that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, God of War is an absolute triumph. It delivers a captivating story, engaging gameplay, and a visually stunning world, all while exploring themes of family, sacrifice, and the consequences of one's actions. This game deserves every bit of praise it has received and more. It is a true testament to the power of video games as a medium, and an experience that no player should miss.",

            "review": "TL;DR - A great game, but it has both good and bad decisions. Solid 7.5 - 8 / 10. Feels like an Arcade version of Monster Hunter.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is the MOST grindy Monster Hunter game I have played, only bested by the JP only MMO Monster Hunter Frontier.\n\nHowever, there's a lot of cool ideas and there is still a lot of fun to be had. Such as the vertical movement, special attacks and if you get the Sunbreak Expansion, new basic combos for each weapon to change up your normal gameplay.\n\nThe mobility is awesome with both player movement and the new dog companion being a mount. The weapons feel slick and fast. Monsters are much more active and can be incredibly aggressive now.\n\nCombat feels awesome, especially when fighting regular monsters. Hits have good weight, each weapon has many options and it's a ton of fun to land some counterattack, or a big move and have the monster stumble and fall to your mighty blow. Or maybe you tapped it with your hand and it collapsed, either way the gameplay is still as solid as ever in any Monster Hunter Title.\n\nOn one hand, they're now more engaging, but on the other hand a lot of the monsters individual personalities feel lost. \n\nIf you're not a completionist, the game should give you about 60-100 hours with friends easily. If you're alone, your gameplay time may vary.\n\nThe endgame in Rise is mostly just fighting the same monsters you've already been fighting, but they have a titanic health pool instead of a normal one, and they hit REALLY hard. You're grinding for a specific material that only drops off this special version, but only about 2 or 3 each hunt. Then, once you grind that same monster enough, it gets stronger and now drops that same item, but STRONGER, and you have to grind that item too. It gets insanely repetitive and boring.\n\nAfter 100%-ing the game with my wife, I uh...I have a final statement.\n\nI have finally earned my freedom.",

It’s a simple concept that’s been used since the first monster hunter game and I think people don’t realize that games can have simple concepts and still be fun. You hunt monsters, you keep hunting monsters, it’s fun. The gameplay is easy but hard to master, love using the charge blade. My only gripe about this game is going from a magnificent feast from monster hunter world…..to just three sticks of dango and a cup of tea, and I get it, it’s a Japanese setting but they could’ve done some yakisona, takoyaki, onigiri and sake. Anyways the game is 10/10 and I thought a lot of the formula and features in world were useless so it’s nice seeing the game going back to the basics without the tracking quests just to report back just so the next time you go out you can actually fight the monster",

Not forget to mention you can fast travel around the Hub and skip the cutscene (thank god). There is no requirement for 'You can only join the quest after the leader watched all cutscenes' anymore.\nMy only a little bit of complaint is how multiplayer works, instead of you can search the quest thats been requested SoS from (MH:World), you search based on target monster or which quest you want to join. So it's impossible to look at list of quest on quest board like in previous iteration.",

It's just not memorable, and anyone who says \"You just hate strong women\" should go remind themselves what the sun looks like.\nBad game, absolutely not worth $60, I've played demos longer than this game.",

            "review": "Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is a survival horror game developed by Capcom and originally released in 1999 for the PlayStation. The game received a remake in 2020, which I will be reviewing below.\n\nThe game follows Jill Valentine, a member of the Raccoon City police department, as she tries to escape the city during a zombie outbreak. She is pursued by a powerful bioweapon called Nemesis, who is sent to eliminate all S.T.A.R.S. members.\n\nThe 2020 remake of Resident Evil 3 features updated graphics and gameplay mechanics, but it also makes some changes to the original game. The biggest change is the removal of certain areas and events, which makes the game shorter than its predecessor.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Resident Evil 3 is a mix of action and survival horror. The game features a dodge mechanic that allows players to avoid enemy attacks and counterattack. \n\nCompared to other games in the series, Resident Evil 3 is generally considered to be less successful than its predecessor, Resident Evil 2. The game received criticism for its shorter length and the removal of certain areas and events from the original game. However, the updated graphics and gameplay mechanics received praise from critics and fans.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil 3 is a solid survival horror game that is worth playing for fans of the genre. However, those who are looking for a longer and more complex game may prefer some of the other games in the series.",

            "review": "Тот случай, когда порекомендую сначала пройти ремейк этой части, нежели после прохождения второго. Дело в том, что на контрасте со вторым ремейком, третий выглядит и играется довольно посредственно и уступает по многим параметрам. Начиная от отсутствия в прежней мере экономить патроны, из-за чего игра превратилась больше в экшен-шутер, нежели сурвайвор, до потешного Немезиса, который вселяет больше смех, чем ужас. Так же игра страдает скудной продолжительностью. И это удивительно, ведь если бы разрабы больше уделили внимания оригиналу, то всего этого можно было избежать. Классику я прошел следом, чтобы понять из-за чего негодовали олды, пройдя ремейк. После чего их негодование стало для меня доходчиво. В ремейке по какой-то причине отсутствует часть локаций и множество головоломок из оригинала, которые могли с легкостью разбавить тон геймплея. Так же в оригинале была малая нелинейность, когда в определенные моменты прохождения застывало время, и можно было выбрать одно из двух действий, которое не кардинально, но меняло исход ситуации. Мне показалось это интересной механикой, которую стоило развить. Хорошо, что хоть додж от поступающих атак оставили. В общем, описанные выше пункты могли стереть самую главную проблему ремейка на мой взгляд. \n\nВ целом же графика и оптимизация на уровне. Персонажи играют и выглядят достойно. Стрельба приятная. Саундтрек неплохой. Игра сохранила некую часть формулы ремейка второй части, но опять же, в сравнении с ним, третий кажется слабым и пустым. Потерянный потенциал. Короткий хронометраж. Упор на зрелищность, экшен для сохранения динамики в геймплее. Отсутствие головоломок и части локаций из оригинала. Комичный Немезис, который к тому же появляется исключительно в рамках скриптовых моментов. Некоторые боссфайты с ним это что-то с чем-то. Пройти все же стоит, но еще раз, настоятельно рекомендую проходить до второго ремейка, чтобы впечатления были слегка ярче из-за неимения на бэкграунде почвы для сравнения. Лорно никакой путаницы для Вас не будет, т.к. события двух ремейков протекают в плюс-минус одно время.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2954744052\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950901679",

            "review": "Хорошая игра, но спорный ремейк\n\nОригинал был для меня одной из знаковых игр в свое время которую я проходил несколько раз. После превосходного ремейка второй части на тройку возлагали огромные надежды, но, как оказалось, напрасно. Может из-за того, что обе игры разрабатывались практически параллельно, может из-за того что разрабы просто спешили, может они просто не угадали с вектором - игру они порезали в местах, где фанаты им не простили. Отчасти я с ними согласен. Не потому что считаю что переносить 100% оригинальных локаций, врагов, боссов, загадок было бы хорошей идеей. А потому что то, что сделано, выглядит как огрызок от игры, которая задумывалась больше, чем она получилась в итоге. Уровень в канализации и уровнем-то назвать сложно, два коридора. \n\nЧто получилось хорошо: помимо, очевидно, технической составляющей, игре прекрасно удалось донести динамику первоисточника, ее идею, на мой взгляд она даже лучше с этим справилась, чем оригинал. Стрельба сочная, есть увороты/уклонения, Немезис дышит в спину и не дает спуску. Загадки убрали да и хрен бы с ними, это атавизм, который только мешает в боевике. \n\nЧего я не могу понять и простить так это ценника. Извините, но такое продавать за 60$ на старте - это кощунство. Мало того что игра короткая сама по себе, она в целом ощущается как длц/спинофф, так в нее никаких режимов не добавили, реиграбельность нулевая. Наемники, напомню, были даже в оригинале. Не удивительно что здесь довольно много охотников за ачивками, люди буквально каждый цент стараются выбить. \n\nЕсли брать для коллекции и не расчесывать фантомные воспоминания об оригинале - рекомендую",

            "review": "[h1] Review[/h1] \nThe original RE3 was great. I really liked it. It was more linear than 1 and 2 but I felt much more dread due to the nemesis being able to appear on a lot of places I didn’t expect and also was able to follow you through doors. It shattered my expectation of the game. Boss fights were mechanically more interesting although the aiming and dodge system were rather broken. I was hyped up for this one as it seemed a game that could be way much better with a remake unlike RE2 which was already really good.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThere is solely two changes in the combat. Defence items got removed, meaning your knife is now unbreakable thus you have to carry it all the time in a no item box run, and the dodge move from RE3 original is back. This time it works very well and considering how the nemesis moves a welcome addition. Although one that makes the game a bit too easy. Combat is much more action focused as is the whole game. It reminds me more of RE6 which I unironically liked. But is that really the route they want to go again?\n\nThere are more difficulties aside veteran, two more you unlock but those tend to also be easy due to the possibility to buy an infinite AR in the points shop after a playthrough or two. You get points for doing challenges.\n\nI must say that I enjoyed the main campaign a lot even though it definitely lacked in a lot of content in areas and became quickly more and more linear. The first area is great where you probably spend an hour or so. After that I was surprised what kind of content they added. Some throwback to RE2 and some scenes where you play as Carlos and run and gun with an assault rifle.\n\nThe main focus is the nemesis but he is an overall less scary version of the one from the original. He’s very predictable here and later on its more just running away from him in a corridor. Its still fun and impressive but the game has such an incredible start gameplay wise. Spectacle wise it stays strong until the end of the game, especially the last boss fight was visually great.\n\nNow the elephant in the room. It lacks content. A lot of it. The first hour is quite faithful while adding a lot of content. After the train ride it’s the opposite. A lot of scenes are scrapped, including the last are, the clocktower, cemetery etc. My first playthrough took me just over 4-5 hours, the second less than 2. My fastest time was around 1 hour and 25 minutes and I’m not a speedrunner. It’s a really short game. A single run in RE2 will take you longer not to mention the Claire/Leon A and B route. Barely any puzzles and not much new. At least you don’t have that awful acid shower battle in the game anymore!\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nYou start off a section as Jill where you get glimpses of her life and what she is up to due to Umbrellas workings. Until you’re suddenly amidst the Zombie outbreak and the Nemesis chases you in a very cool although heavily scripted sequence.\n\n[u]Sound[/u]\nI really like the new ost, it’s a more complex version of some tracks of the original. Although I prefer the raw dread the original nemesis theme presented. Again, game is available in a lot of voiced languages! Always like this commitment.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nNot much changed from RE2 although the texture models of the characters are much better! There are also a lot more visually interesting places especially the chaos from the outbreak in the start of the game.\n\n[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]\nI really enjoyed my short playthrough of this game. But considering it as a remake it doesn’t add enough to justify the content they cut. Especially since places like the clocktower museum which was my favourite are missing! Unlike RE2 remake it doesn’t stay that faithful while adding more content but rather just does this in the first half of the game. After that it gets much more linear and solely became a rather fun action focused game. Could have expanded and improved the content RE3 had and it would have made my favourite RE title. Still worth looking into as the game is still an enjoyable rollercoaster ride.\n\n7/10 Good game",

And I like it! Every member of the Van der Linde gang feels like a real person with their own distinct personality and backstory. You'll grow to love them, hate them, and feel for them as the story progresses.[/list] [quote=Arthur Morgan][b]Vengeance Is An Idiot’s Game[/b][/quote] [list] [*]and the game drives home this point in a powerful way. The consequences of revenge are explored through the characters' actions and the outcomes that follow. The game shows that revenge only leads to more pain and suffering, and the only way to break the cycle is through forgiveness and redemption.\n[*][b][u]RDR 2 is a game that you don't just play, but you live.[/u][/b] This is the best game of this generation. If you're a fan of open-world games, westerns, or just great storytelling, you owe it to yourself to play this game.

[b][i] Do note that I don't usually write a review or make an essay out of it but this game deserve one!. [/i][/b] The game itself is very immersive probably one of the best I've experienced. The landscapes are awe-inspiring, from the rugged mountains to the rolling plains, each with its own distinct atmosphere and beauty. The attention to detail is staggering, with dynamic weather and realistic animal behavior breathing life into the surroundings. It's a world that basically begs players to explore.\n\n[b] Development [/b]\nThe greatest thing R2D2 have to offer is the deeply engrossing character development of Arthur Morgan. As a member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur is a complex protagonist with a troubled past and a conflicted moral compass. Through the course of the game, players witness his transformation from a loyal outlaw blindly following his leader to a man questioning his actions and searching for redemption. The writing and voice acting are exceptional, capturing the nuances of Arthur's personality and emotional growth.\n\n[b] World Immersion[/b]\nThe open world is filled with diverse missions, side quests, and activities that complement the overarching story. Whether engaging in intense shootouts (as always~), doing heists, or simply exploring the wilderness, the gameplay remains consistently captivating. I have over 70+ hours now and I haven't even complete my first playthrough (due to exploring the map, side-activities and irl education/work). With all that, there are still things which I have yet too discover! Like who is Gavin??!\n\n[b] TRY IT! [/b]\nWhether you're drawn to the allure of the Wild West or simply appreciate a masterfully story driven game, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute must-play. While writing this down I should also note that Arthur Morgan is hands down the best protagonist out there!<3\n\n왜 아직도 읽고 있니? 이미 구입!\n그리고 모두 즐겁게~~",

            "review": "[h3]Now THIS is how to tell a story.[/h3]\nRed Dead Redemption 2 features the most gripping narrative I’ve ever seen in a video game. The epic journey of Dutch Van der Linde's gang of outlaws is full of so many jaw-dropping, cinematic, action-packed moments, but still stays believable as the protagonist Arthur Morgan slowly frees himself of his life-long gunslinger ideals. And every character in the Van der Linde gang’s saga feels remarkably human, thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting that perfectly complement this game’s stunning visuals, detailed animation and beautiful music.\n\nAll of these elements combine to make the world of Red Dead 2 come alive in a way that no other open world game does. The massive five-state map is incredibly dynamic, with missions, side quests and random events of equally high quality perfectly interwoven into an enchanting world that constantly changes with the flow of the main story. And there are so many little details throughout this game - from memorable NPCs to colorful customization options to fleshed-out minigames - that make the experience feel authentic.\n\nEven though I absolutely loved the phenomenal story and atmospheric world of Red Dead 2, the gameplay mechanics can seem shallow when taken out of context. Granted, there’s nothing wrong with the core controls - the shootouts are fun even on controller thanks to the Deadeye time-slowdown ability, and riding around on a horse is simple but satisfying. However, responsive controls are sometimes de-emphasized in favor of handholding gameplay and \"realism\" in regard to difficulty and mission structure. Horses automatically steer themselves on rough terrain, animations make looting and crafting take longer, many missions include trailing sections so the player can get where they need to go… et cetera.\n\nUsually, when a game prioritizes realism over immediate gameplay like this, there’s a weak link somewhere that breaks my immersion - such as bad voice acting, weak writing, faults in sound design or visuals, or spacing of content around the map. And this usually results in these “realistic” game mechanics becoming more tedious than they are immersive, distancing me from whatever atmosphere is trying to be established. But.. this isn’t the case with Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\n[h3]Red Dead 2 might be the first game to [i]fully convince[/i] me of its own world's authenticity.[/h3]\nThe immaculately detailed world and unbelievably human characters of RDR2 breathe life into in-game tasks that I would normally consider boring, like trailing missions, herding animals and catching fish - making even these less inspired gameplay segments pretty damn fun. The gameplay mechanics aren’t untouchable on their own, but the sixty-hour-long story pretty much is, and it’s paired with an intricate portrayal of 1899 America that makes the narrative just as enthralling as some of the greatest movies and TV shows ever made. This commitment to realism and thorough storytelling makes even the slower paced segments of the game exciting, and the intense parts (like shootouts) more meaningful.\n\nI’m already partway through my second playthrough now, and I’m having even more fun this time around trying to dissect the incredible character dynamics and details of the open world now that I’ve beaten the game already. The more I play Red Dead 2, the more fascinated I am with the spectacular story and cast of characters - and the few issues I originally had with the mechanics have become less and less noticeable in the grand scheme of RDR2’s monumental scope. Rockstar has created a true masterpiece here, and the gripping tale of outlaw Arthur Morgan is a story I’ll never forget. 10/10",

With a 3090ti that can perfectly run 2023 games on max settings, this almost 4 year old game refuses to work correctly. Random crashes all around. It will probably (hopefully) be fixed, but the fact that it came to this, I just find unaccaptable. And I'm not the only one unable to play the game, just take one look at the community page and you'll see plenty of other people that are not allowed to enjoy the product they paid for. \n\nGotta love modern gaming when the devs can update the game so that it no longer works\n\n\nERR_GFX_STATE",

        "notes": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Alexios or Kassandra, mercenaries on a quest for vengeance. As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., “Anything goes in this sex andron”; “That is love, this is commerce. What are you into?”); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game. "

This game is definitely beautiful and large. \n\nThe story is amazing, if you like the main thing in the lore of Assassins creed, this game definitely gives you a lot of info on it. And choices you make matter, i will definitely be playing it with new game+ and do things that i wish i had done differently. But i recommend you to play it not knowing what choices do what down the line, since you can play as the female [spoiler] Kassandra [/spoiler] , and or the male [spoiler] Alexios [/spoiler].\n\nAt the start of the game i felt a bit overwhelmed by everything, but after exploring a bit and doing some quests i got a hang of it. \nin comparison to Origins, its not as good, but its still a Master piece!\n\nThe main quests and side quests are great, but there are these quests all around that have a time glass on them, those quests feel poorly made. Most of the dialogue in those quests are interesting at the start, but then when it comes to what they want you to do, it defaults to the same ones over and over and over again. so i just skip the dialogue most of the time. Although very rarely they will say something new. Often you get a dialogue decision to ask them what they want from you, but its always just answer nr1, so it feels tedious, like they added it in to make you want to listen to the dialogue, which after 100 hours, I don't. These quests are also the main way (from what I've seen) to get XP and money, and they are usually very short and just boring.\n\nFor some reason they designed the horse to trot when you are 200 meters within a city, town, fort or whatever, and it doesn't matter if its way above you on a cliff, your horse will not gallop. Which is extremely annoying and i don't understand why they did this\n\nThey have a great system for your armor and weapons, where you can change the look of your armor to any you have received. although i don't understand why epic armor has 3 engravings enabling you to get 4, while the legendary armor only has 2 unless you have the complete set which then you get 3, plus you could add the 4th. but this makes the epic armor way better in most cases, as you can get much better engravings on them than the legendary. \n\nThe combat is alright, similar to Origins except you don't have a shield.\n\nThe game doesn't really tell you how to change arrows except in the loading screens where it occasionally pops up telling you to press g to switch arrows, didn't see that hint until like 40 hours in, and at that point i just googled it.\n\nThe boat battles are cool, and different from the old games, in a good way. the upgrades get ridiculously expensive, but you make the money back fast, but the resources can be a hassle.\n\nI have a lot more I could say about this game, but I think I've covered what stood out the most for me\n\nI Recommend this game, you get a long playtime and it has good replay value.",

            "review": "Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a highly immersive and detailed action-adventure game from Ubisoft. From the stunning Ancient Greek landscapes and cities, to the engaging storyline and engaging combat and stealth mechanics, this game has a lot of exciting content and provides hours of quality entertainment. With its big open world packed with side-quests, bounties and mysterious artifacts to uncover, this game will keep you hooked for weeks. One of the most standout aspects of the game is its incredible attention to detail, with period-accurate buildings, characters, and artwork. The game also features an engaging narrative that takes its time to tell, allowing for some truly fascinating moments that will leave a lasting impression. With its deep character customization and upgrade systems, Odyssey also provides a unique and varied experience that can be tailored to the player’s preference. While some aspects of the game can be tedious, it never detracts from the overall experience, and the engaging gameplay kept me coming back for more. Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is an enjoyable action-adventure game with an enormous amount of content, engaging combat, and an interesting storyline. Its immersive world and varied mechanics provide an enjoyable, memorable experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging game.",

            "review": "First of all, as preface, I have achieved basically 100% in this game including the two DLCs so one could I say I really love and adore this game. \n\nHaving said that, this game is definitely not a perfect game for everyone. The story is a tad bit bland overall and isn't what hooked me in this game. I mostly ignored the main quest really until I powered through it in one or two sittings. Adding to that, this game didn't feel as much as a typical game in the Assassins Creed series but more as a RPG in the world of Assassins Creed, which is totally fine for me because it's still a great game, but I understand everyone who was a little disappointed.\nWhat really chained to this game though, is the world building and the main character (DISCLAIMER: I played as Kassandra). \nKassandra to me, was one of the most loveable (and hot; I admit it :) ) protagonists I've ever played with. I love her personality and attitude but also the genuine sorrow and grief they were able to make her show. On top of that, her voice actress/also her motion double did such an outstanding job.\nNow to the world the developing team put out: I'm not from Greece and hvae only been there a few times, but I absolutely loved every second of exploring the ancient version. They really made the world feel alive and inhabitated and while fulfilling objectives on the map was, due to it being mostly Copy and Paste as Ubisoft typically does, pretty boring most of the times, I still had the motivation to keep going the whole distance. And let me tell you: The world is actually enormous. Part of the reason I kept going definitely were the mechanics overall and especially during fighting. The ability tree is really well made and almost all abilities feel useful at some point and in some build. Naturally some abilities are generally more useful than other but the overall balance is very good.\n\nIn short: I really enjoyed the game and it is a really good RPG, probably one of the best I have ever played and I enjoyed every second I played.",

Nice story, good gameplay (of the new AC RPG-style, not older AC, not better not worse, just different)\nBut recently I launch the game again, wanting to fully finish it. And here's an invasive UBI Launcher, that requires me to create an account. This thing will take space on my disk, need updates, push newsletters and advertisement on me. Besides you just can't play if UBI servers are offline. The game worked perfectly without it.\nThis is shameful methods. I'll check on the game in few years to see if launcher is removed and update my review then.\n\ntl;dr : awesome game, go for it if you don't mind predatory commercial practices",

I finally got decent enough to have ONE efficient game, ONE, in which I LOST, and when it went to cash out the 1500vc(which is NOTHING), for some reason the server felt in needed to investigate and ended up crashing my game, and when I got back on, I was banned. I will never buy another 2k product, I will pirate the game, and I will use cheat engines and everything they don't want us to use that costs them money out of their greedy a** pockets. We get old gen games at new gen prices, they treat the honest players like trash, they can't do anything to combat the cheaters, and they care only about money, not their product. It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen.",

            "review": "NBA 2K23 is a yet another follow-up in the long-standing 2K basketball franchise that continues to release repeated versions of the same game, re-skinned and re-titled to fit the year, and the real-life players drafted that year, it represents. As expected the core gameplay has been worked on to perfection for years now so players know what will be brought to the table - just an overall smooth and crushingly-detailed basketball simulator. This isn't the first time Micheal Jordan has graced the cover of a 2K sports game, but a lot of time has passed since then and things have changed for the good and for the bad.\n\nIf you look to play this, you have to consider many things: do you care about the you-against-the-AI aspect of it all or do you really crave that online player-vs-player feel. If your heart lies somewhere in the middle, you have to choose a side here because there's no in-between. Playing online-only means that you will have two years at max before the servers are shut down intentionally, forcing you to pay top dollar for the inevitable next installment. Playing against the AI means 2K can't do s**t to you if you want to stay in 2K23, having fun at the various modes it has to offer - NBA 2K23 will be playable even after the specific game has been deleted from the store. So choose carefully... when it's on sale (don't feed the pigs even more).\n\nOn PC, this game is fun to play against the AI - no bugs, no glitches and an overall satisfied experience playing completely alone. Do I recommend NBA 2K23? Yes, if you play against the AI, If you aim to play online - please read the other reviews of players who've had an even greater experience than me there. It's a lot to unpack there, for sure.\n\nFollow your heart.",

But you'd enjoy one of the older games, especially the 2k14 one which is, imo, the best one on steam. \n\nAlso for no reason at all this game is 123GB large and it uses the last generation engine. Why is it so large, I have no idea when there are games that offer 6x the content as this and are only 50gbs. So yeah its not really worth buying, but if you want to have this year's game them go for it. You'll have fun",

MyCareer is basically very complex and broken. There are a lot of hacker and stupid issues in game. If you want to play MyPark, you shouldn't. You need to know 2K loves money (VC). I dont have any NBA game,so I bought it and I'm not regret. There are a lot of negative reviews, I'm just playing MyTeam and I will just play MyTeam so I didnt see anything that bad. I almost forgot,there is no 144hz in game. How ?. In 2023 %85 of the players has 144hz or 144+hz monitors.It's not that big deal but If I have this specs,I want to use it. CPU sometimes can do odd movements like Cedi Osman posterized my Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I read too many review people wrote about game crash and bugs.At auction house, just for once, my game just crashed. If you don't have any nba game and you just want to play MyTeam and versus to your friends,you can buy.\n\n\n[b] WARNING : IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MYPARK OR MYCAREER AND YOU ARE BUYING FOR THIS PURPOSE YOU SHOULD KNOW,THIS GAME HAS NO ANTI-CHEAT !  [/b] \n\n[b] WARNING 2 : IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY CONTROLLER DEVICE, DONT BUY THIS GAME. AT THE ENTERANCE GAME GIVING ADVICE ABOUT THIS MATTER.  [/b]",

It is facing driver issues (not the wheel or cars, but game drivers) and Microsoft is blaming the chip/graphics companies. The drivers don't face issues with other games, but as of the Steam Beta UI being released to everyone, it has started acting up. People have rolled back but it only seems to work for a couple of people. I'd suggest waiting until this issue is fixed before you buy this game. \n\nIn which case, if they stop being lazy and actually fix the game, with a small patch, I promise I'll change my review. I want to say good stuff, but I won't recommend this to anyone until issues have been dealt with.\n\nI hope you readers understand. Its a good game. But until something is done, don't buy. Please. It'll save you.",

Going online for help is just getting bombarded with the same solutions to update your drivers, reinstall, make sure your firewall isn't blocking it, etc... well guess what? Not a single thing works. Have fun rolling the dice with this game and trying to actually play it.

            "review": "All Orcs Must Die games have been one of the best Tower Defense games made. Didn't seem like their heart was in OMD3 and seemed to be a fast cash game (maybe to support another game) that hasn't changed much since OMD2. It's a fun game for a few months at most, but the additional subject matter that was added to this game is lacking. I think most players noticed this after posting a good review, but didn't take the time to revise their review, because of the state of games today. If we had any other similar game options to compare, we would have noticed how little OMD3 has improved. \n\nUnchained had many issues, but this game seems to have a lot of the same and a few new issues. Adding more orcs on the screen at one time was nice (for a few maps) but most of the maps are small without much strategy or manipulating needed at all. Teamwork was much better in Unchained and I didn't feel like another game publisher was out to get more money than the game was worth. Seems the only thing this game did to make the maps \"hard\" was add more life and greatly increase the speed of the orcs. This made some of the smaller maps seem like the orcs were running faster than the heroes. Don't get me started on the lack of money we started with. Can't give us much money to buy traps when the maps are so small and boring. The 'good o' days' of gaming is lost with the must pay more for DLC (just to be a full game) or pay-to-win styles that have taken over.",

The core mechanics and gameplay found here are solid and entertaining, and that is usually the hardest part to nail in a game. However, everything around that core is a chore.\n\nI am playing Borderlands 3 with multiple mods that remove dialogue and speed up animations, and the game still plays out incredibly slowly. There is a lot of starting and stopping, all the time, and then you have to sit through a lot of exposition from some uninportant side character, with nothing much to do because progression is tied to these monologues. Story in a game that is basically about upgrading loot should be skippable, but no... even with mods you still need to sit through the animations and so on.\n\nIf you add that to the fact that the difficulty is quite low overall, certainly lower than the two games before it, you end up with a great game being held back by the developers' obsession with the idea that they are great storytellers and that somehow this is the main point of the game. All the praise heaped upon Borderlands 2's story must be at fault here, but that was a juvenile story to begin with, propped up by interesting characters.\n\nI can't say I recommend it, even though that parts that you are actually allowed to play are very fun. It often just feels like the game is wasting your time.",

But hey, that's just Borderlands being Borderlands. This has nothing to do with my not recommending the game to others!\n\nI do not recommend this game because of the CONSTANT AND RELENTLESS reminders and offers to buy the DLC you are stricken with as the game goes on. All throughout the hub ship and sometimes other places as well you'll see quest markers letting you know you have a new quest available - except you can only accept the quest(s) if you own the DLC. Well, this means the quest markers never go away!\n\nOkay, so you try to remember the markers are part of a DLC and won't ever go away and just do your best to ignore them, right? Wrong. Passing by some of these DLC quest markers makes you receive an immediate radio message from the \"main story protagonist\" of said DLC letting you know they want to talk to you. This happens every time you return to the main hub and pass by it again. Some of them are placed near often-revisited NPCs and resources like the item vault so you can't avoid hearing them.\n\nThe whole thing just feels super scummy and predatory and I don't feel right supporting such practices.",

            "review": "Borderlands 3 has many facets that are great, and clear upgrades to its predecessors, such as the satisfying gunplay and the improved visuals. The game can be incredibly fun when you just get to zoom around the gameworld, shooting and killing everything that has a healthbar. The new vault hunters - Fl4k, Moze, Amara and Zane - have much more intricate and varied skill trees, and the introduction of Mayhem Mode should - in theory - add some much needed endgame. Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) was thankfully removed, and we don't have to deal with slag as a necessary evil anymore, either.\nBossfights are generally decent. They aren't particularly mechanical or demanding, but get the job done.\nCo-op is (as always) the best aspect of the game, it can truly be a blast.\n\nHowever, moments when the game is purely enjoyable are rare.\nThe first and most obvious weakness is the writing of the game. Characters are tropey, to the point that they feel like their dialogue was generated by a GenZ intern using ChatGPT. While the terrible dialogue adequately lends itself to the very one-dimensional villains, which are essentially just evil for evils sake and lack the same depth that Handsome Jack had in BL2, it becomes increasingly unbearable as the game goes on.\nDon't even get me started on Ava, who might just be the worst character in any video game series so far.\nThere seems to be one repeating plot device: You defeat some kind of minor villain, you enter a fairly uninteresting, small vault for a minute, shit happens once you come out (someone gets killed or kidnapped, generally) and then you have to resolve the occurred shit before you can enter the next vault.\n\nThe pacing is pretty awful, as well. During the story (or any sidequest for that matter) you will also have to just sit around, waiting for dialogue to end, -constantly-. Buttons will be locked before a character has finished their speech, and the same holds true for objects that can only be destroyed once you have sat around long enough. This is fine on the first playthrough, but takes away massively from the replayability of the game. Many jokes have been made about BL3 being a \"Talk to Lilith\" simulator, and they are entirely accurate.\n\nYou will find a ton of bugs in this game, and I'm not just talking about the alien enemies. The game is littered with minor annoyances, such as incorrectly appearing subtitles, quests that don't correctly progress, NPCs (and your own vault hunter) getting stuck.. Most of them can be fixed by fast travelling or reloading the game, but there is one sidequest that can genuinely just break with no fix in sight (and this has been known since the game's release on Epic).\nAs a last point, the DLCs are overall pretty interesting (I particularly like the Gehenna and Xylurgous DLCs) and do a much better job than the basegame, even though they are plagued by a lot of the same problems. However, I find it hard to feel good about it as you would have to pay over 100€ to get all of the content unless you buy the game on sale.\n\nOverall, BL3 falls flat in many regards. I would not recommend this game for its full price, though it is certainly worth it for 1-2 playthroughs if you buy it on sale.\n",

So tuning it down a little bit would be good i think.\n\nMy second point is the difficulty, the game is really easy if you do just about any of the side quests.\nHaving an inventory full of powerful legendary guns doesn't help this.\nIf you are like me and do all side missions before continuing the story, you will likely melt bosses in seconds with the only thing stopping you being their (very annoying) invincibility phases",

            "review": "The absolute passion and soul poured into this game is unmatched and it's criminal that this didn't release to bigger success. The best way I can possibly describe it is like a sourcemod from an alternate universe where the developers had budgets, which should be no surprise considering who made it. If you've played nightmare house 2 or underhell you'll immediately understand, the game contains some tricky hl2 style platforming and the character controls extremely similar to Gordon, the only thing missing is the crouch jump. \nOtherwise I mean, it's a fantastic game. Story has a very interesting concept and the voice acting is really good, puzzles are decent and the setpieces are truly phenomenal- like the spooky mannequins that move when you're not looking but they actually help you this time. General combat is fairly mediocre with only a few enemy types, but it doesn't detract much. I also like how the big bad in each level, you know, the enemy you can't kill always has some weakness you can use to temporarily disable them so they get in your way less.\nThe weakest part would have to be the old factory, which contains an annoying building crawl searching for keys and an ABOMINABLE conveyor belt puzzle you have to solve while the big bad chases you around in a confined space. Generally, if you're expecting something really hardcore scary like Amnesia you might be disappointed, it's more of an adventure game with horror aesthetics sort of like Alan Wake. Honestly I prefer these, the gameplay has a lot more room to breathe when the developer isn't constantly trying to freak you out with unkillable stalkers and sanity management systems.\nThe best part by far in my opinion is something small, it's how every note you pick up is unique. It's not just a text popup like most games. Every character has different handwriting just like real life. Agent Rainbow, the main villain, writes in big scratchy oil slick text which gives him even more personality. It really is minor, but it shows a level of care you don't see too often.",

Two of the more standout issues are the memory leak in Halo CE, a major problem where it starts eating your ram like a pig at a candy trough and Halo Reach missing most of its ambiance on certain levels, notably Sword Base. Other issues include terrible netcode in campaign mode, good luck if you try to play anything other than 3 with a friend, lack of split screen, and lack of a dedicated Custom Games Browser that isn't shackled to Easy Anti-Cheat.",

With over 2000 hours in the series, I highly recommend multiplayer, either solo or with friends. Playing these games with friends brings back the nostalgia of coming home from a long day and playing all night. I will keep playing until I finally get all the achievements this game offers.",

Solutions online suggest you verify integrity of game files (done), cap fps at 60 for all players (done), and finally reconfigure your router settings so that all players have an 'Open NAT'. I remember reconfiguring my router settings 15 years ago to play Halo 3 online, it is asinine that this is still an issue. The MCC was released in 2020 and yet even now network issues persist. Reading through the Steam discussions, these connection errors are very common. I would refund this game if I still could. It is a bare minimum ask that a multiplayer-oriented game have functional co-op multiplayer, which the MCC does not.",

A game I thought would be a joke or a goof or something badly made or not worth my time or money.\n\nWell...I played it for a decent amount of time and came to a conclusion. \n\nAt the very least it's worth it's asking price. It's not awful. Sure it's not perfect but in terms of simulator games it's actually pretty good.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and in depth although maybe a bit repetitive and sometimes boring.\n\nConfusing right? I know but it's still the truth.\n\nIt has a lot, like choosing where to set up shop, customizing it in a lot of different ways including creating your own coffee recipes right down to what kind of cup you use or what kind of ice you use. Tons of different decorations and styles for your coffee shop and more.\n\nIt even has cutscenes, voice acting, a campaign story mode, a decent tutorial decent graphics and sound. I mean overall this game is pretty decent. That's the word of the day. DECENT.\n\nThe game is DECENT.\n\nSo it's worth your money and your time. But only if you're into simulator games with a lot of managing and sitting around watching things happen. If that doesn't sound interesting to you then you should probably pass on this one.\n\nBut I mean I liked it cuz I knew (more or less) what I was getting into. But it offered me far more than I was expecting which was really nice. If you'd like a more in depth look with gameplay then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel (link below).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9lgH_cSnsM\n\nOtherwise thanks for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely.\n",

You pay exactly for what you get a relaxing and climatic coffee shop simulator.\n\nThe Latte Art is realy fun and satisfaing to use. I allways wanted to do something like that and now I can, maybe in a video game but still it counts :D \n\nTutorial is simple and easy. What's more the campaing is engaging and I felt motivated to complete it to unlock levels in sandbox mode which by the way is even more fun :D UNLIMITED MONEY!!!!\n\nOverall great game that you can easly play for houndres hours and don't get bored as there is a lot of customization. (I think you can use Latte Art allone for tens of hours)",

The developers clearly put a lot of effort into this and it shows in every aspect of the final product.\n\nI dislike the game because it's business and customer mechanics are very poorly fleshed out.\nWhen you go to a coffee shop, you order your coffee how you like it, and the baristas make it how you like it.\nWhat makes a coffee shop good is the beans, their staff, and what they are capable of making.\n\nEspresso Tycoon chooses to boil down these ideas into \"social classes\", each of which will prefer an [i]exact specific drink[/i] and not order anything else. It is your job to create specialty drinks that directly appeal to each of the 8 social classes, or they won't order from your shop. The specialty drinks often involve mayonnaise, copious amounts of syrup and ice cream, and weird calorie/temp/caffeine criteria. \n\nI just don't think it's a good direction. The novelty of creating these beverages wears off after the first two or three, and it just ends up being a repetitive chore. We make our drinks and then we just... sit around and wait. yay.\n\nThe game is otherwise very well polished (better than some AAA games I've played recently...) and so I'm very confident future updates will be able to make the gameplay more engaging.",

Whole chains of cafes have some recipes that they stick to, like the popular Pumpkin Spice Latte which is the same in every coffee shop all around the world.\n\nIn games, it is sometimes necessary to simplify certain aspects in order to develop the overall mechanics of the game. This means, in this case, making assumptions about whether customers will buy coffee made by players. We chose to use social groups as a solution, as it has proven successful in many classic games (such as Pizza Connection, which was one of our inspirations). However, I understand your point of view.\n\nI'm curious, though, if you truly believe our game deserves a negative review, considering you've listed many advantages (for which I'm very grateful!). Is there anything we could improve that would change your opinion?\n\nThank you for your time!"

You are not left wanting for more because each level is challenging in itself and it gets progressively harder and more in depth as you go. Its a great way to learn and to play at the same time without being overwhelmed or bored. I give this game a 9.5/10 so far and I've only just reached level 5 in the missions. \n\n         Then there is the sandbox mode. I have not yet tried this but I've heard from the developers themselves that you do not need to unlock anything in order to play it. Everything is already unlocked when you select this option. \n\nThe music is relaxing. The graphics beautiful. The decoration options available are great. \n\n         Bring your creative juices, your own cup of beverage you desire and get ready to play for hours without realizing it.

While some aspects are truly \"game play\" mechanics, others are ripped straight out of a coffee shop manager's admin tasks. When I saw the gantt chart shift scheduling I was already having flashbacks to dealing with schedules in Kronos. Oh you need a second barista during peak? Look to hire. Oh, but Bobby can only work 4 hours and prefers evenings? Shift everyone else around to accommodate! And don't even get me started on allowing butter and mayo in coffee drinks! I simultaneously hate it and love it. The only critic I have is inventory management is a little clunky. It's nice that it give you a heads up when supply is running low, but I would love and end of day report or something that would just isolate the ingredients you currently order onto one page for quick mass reordering. I would also love and option for the store to autoclose when your barista leaves. The employees have schedules, why couldn't the shop have store hours? \n\nFinal verdict: great game, you get exactly the experience you think you will get at the price you pay. A few quality of life improvements could help mechanics in the future, but gameplay is solid.",

You won't need spend much time into it on a gameplay session unless you are into maximizing your profits, designing your coffee shops with tables and decorations and coffees themselves. \nThe think the game takes some inspirations from Chef Life and Tavern Master which is good.

I tried all the ways possible to fix it and none of the ones I found worked. But it gets even worse, cause the day before I wanted to buy DLCs everything was just fine, I hosted a lobby and everything worked perfect, and nothing has changed since that day. And we don`t really want to play standart UNO, and since I can`t host a game and my friends don`t have DLCs or want to buy one, we just don`t play it. If they at least added feature allowing host of the lobby launching DLCs other players in lobby have, I wouldn`t complain, but there isn`t one so this game is just waste of money.",

The added benefit of this is when your friend finishes the game on a draw 4 card for the second time that night you can punch them instead of your monitor.",

Each playable character, Dante, Nero, V, and Vergil has their own theme song that hits hard and complements their unique personality. The music perfectly syncs with the intense battles, amplifying the adrenaline rush and making every fight feel powerful.\n\nThe story is straightforward and solid, and is all packaged with engaging and epic moments. \n\nDevil May Cry 5 is an amazing video game that deserves is praise and hype. \n\nI give this game a Smokin' Sexy Style 10/10!!",

The game is heavily focused on you moving your colony around and manually setting up very temporary drills. In Satisfactory or Factorio 1 drill can last you an insane amount of time with the former lasting forever. Here, that doesn't apply. Drills have to be repeatedly moved regularly and that sucks, the core concept seems it really wants you to constantly move across the universe and stopping when you see big islands and setting up. \n\nThen there is another negative with how much of the same material is out right needed in all production and how much it gets cycled back. In Satisfactory or Factorio it felt like a progress of the use of minerals... here it feels like an endless loop and dance and since the only constant supply is literally random minerals it makes it very annoying to setup a layout in a way I'd prefer.\n\nThis game had a lot of promise for me and I enjoyed it for what I spent on it but overall I just don't see it improving to a point where I'd personally recommend it to other friends who thoroughly enjoy Satisfactory or Factorio and love space like I do.\n\n\nEDIT: \nIt is so incredibly hard to put into words how this doesn't really line up and give an enjoyable experience. Part of the problem is there IS automation but the automation is.... annoying and still requires a lot of manual effort to maintain. Even if you are able to come up with a design the filters and splits.... new problems occur. It isn't really a fun problem to solve. In Factorio and Satisfactory there is an absolute feeling of progressing with materials that doesn't require insane juggling early on. Here.... I feel like it is just a constant juggle even from the start and it never seems to end in an experience that feels smooth. That and the research is not a slow research... its fast... so fast I don't even see the point of why it is setup like it is. In 10 mins you will research like 10 different things confusing the hell out of what you just really learned and how to utilize it. In the short time I played I have researched over 40+ things.... it is overly complicated design and when you complete the research it doesn't feel like it really applies to anything for a bit but just BASIC unlocks, which isn't bad but with how much it is it is just all over the place. \n\nFor example, once I researched smelting. I thought there would be a little bit of time understanding it and more mechanics INVOLVED with it.... but within literal minutes you are already learning the thing after that and the thing after that and the thing after that... now you have to have fun plugging it all in.... \n\nIdk its just so many things are all over the place in this game for me and it just isn't for me.",

You can decide what resources you want to catch.\n\nCORE CONCEPT\nIt's the game about exploration, so it's a challenge where you need to find resources (more advanced) since you can use asteroid catchers for others.\n\nLOGISTICS\nThere are logic blocks which are quite entertaining, allowing to design an efficient space station. Once again, it's a challenge, but it's really rewarding.\n\nPROGRESSION\nThere is no rush to go on with every single research. Some players are taking time to scale production first, making 10 automated catchers before moving on.\n\nThank you for your observations. Could you please share how would you make progression more enjoyable?\n\nKind regards,\nTefel"

This is really easily solvable, all we would need is the ability to have a \"Maintain X copper wire\" setting instead of only having \"always craft copper wire\" and \"Craft X copper wire 1 time.\" Copper wire is just the example, of course, this setting should exist for all materials.\n\nI also wish the oxygen production was a bit more straightforward, the first thing you learn to craft is the oxygen machine, but it doesn't actually do anything except eat ice that you input manually until much later on after you spend a lot more research points.\n\nThe game looks like it could be something  someday, after a lot more work has gone into QOL but right now I couldn't really get into it for the simple fact that I was completely turned off by the early game inventory management.\n\nIn response to the developer:\n\nI'm going to assume there is a language barrier because you don't seem to understand what I meant in my first paragraph about maintaining X resources. \n\nWhat is currently there is a 1 time build order. This is fine if you don't mind going back to make more build orders once your resources run out, however during the early game resources are constantly running out. What I am suggesting is a build order to always craft up to X amount of a resource when its parent resources are available. For example, you can always set ingots to produce infinitely, but once you start crafting wires, you need to make sure you aren't running out of ingots. Ideally you could tell the hand craft menu to always produce iron bars, and to craft up to 10 iron wire, no more than that, forever. This ensures that you always have some iron wire and some iron ingots, I hope that is clearer.\n\nAdmittedly I missed the \"move\" command, so I will remove that from the review. \n\nI get that you're probably sick of hearing QOL in negative reviews, but there's definitely a reason you keep hearing it. Overall, doing things in the game just feels clunky, whether it is inventory management or resource management, it just feels like a chore to do stuff rather than a game. Not trying to be harsh, but I don't need to spend 50 hours in a game to know that I'm going to enjoy playing more of it. If I see things added in the patch notes farther down the line, I will come back because I think you have something with this game, it's just not there yet.",

You press \"I want 10 copper bars\" and the recipe disables when it crafts 10 copper bars.\n\nMOVING once again is in the game - you simply remove and place it back without paying a cost.\n\nThere are already 2 years of adding QOL, so I wish you can spend a little bit more time with a game to discover them.\n\nKind Regards,\nTefel"

User experience may vary, but on my platform I also had occasional stuttering.\n- QOL is very scant, navigating menus is a nightmare, handcrafting defaults to endless production of individual items, placing floating objects do not snap to connection points, controls by default aren't intuitive and required a decent bit of remapping\n\nOverall: Decent quality for early access, not really worth buying at present but has a ton of potential to be as good as similar sandbox factory games.",

I have yet to get to late game, so I'll probably update this later.\n\nThe good:\n- It's a factory game and factory games are fun\n- The base structures of automation are there\n- Colonists being part of the ecosystem is pretty cool, though not very fleshed out\n- Flying around and collecting islands/planetoids is cool as shit\n- Starting out with freedom of movement is wonderful\n\nThe not so good:\n- Some basic QOL is missing:\n- Default hotkeys are absolutely awful. They ideally would utilize only my left hand so I don't have to constantly take my hand off my mouse to hit keys. This should be done with CTRL/SHIFT modifiers where necessary. Both construction and inventory require you do this and they're both extremely common. Like why?\n- Mass deleting should just use Ctrl + Right Click, or whatever you have bound to the single destroy hotkey instead of a separate key. There is no instance where I'm highlighting stuff and would want to delete a separate item.\n- The biggest one that some others have mentioned: logistics does not feel good to use. The fact that machines have no capacity limits means that instead of just dropping down easy pushers, you have to fiddle with splitter ratios. I don't want to set custom ratios for every machine. I'd prefer to set up a saturated main bus and branch off where necessary without having to worry about proper ratios. I'm dreading redoing/expanding my base just because of how boring it will be to set up all the splitter ratios. Maybe I'm missing something here, in which case I'd love if someone could enlighten me.\n\nThe neutral/personal desires:\n- I wish flooring was somehow cheaper or the starting colony area was larger. Early game can be quite grindy when you start running out of space. 1 plate per tiny floor piece is not too expensive, but it adds up quickly with how large all the machines are.\n- I'd love a pickaxe upgrade somewhere. Unlocking nuclear fusion and still mining stuff at the same speed as the beginning doesn't make much sense.\n- I probably just haven't unlocked it/seen it yet, but basic belts are really slow. The dev has mentioned in other comments how unused materials can just get passed through machines, but this isn't really feasible when belts get clogged so easily.\n- In 2 player multiplayer the bot/tutorials only show up for the host and not for the other person. I assume this is already planned to be fixed since multiplayer is mentioned as being barebones.\n\nI'm enjoying the game so far and will probably get my money's worth, but I hope the dev can implement some more QOL stuff so the game doesn't feel quite as janky.",

The HDR-like lighting looks awesome, not sure I've seen it better in any other VR game:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986612315\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986610579\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986614346\n\nThe best I could do was to max out all graphics settings in-game (leave res slider at 1.0), select Index res 225% in 80 Hz and disable motion smoothing. Then I had solid 80 fps - but I'm only 1.5 hours into the game. \n\nThe fighting is better in HellSplit, in Undead Citadel it feels like there's some latency to sword swinging, which devs may have done to simulate some weight and (lack of) precision.\n\nI do love the voice actor behind this game - this is a game for adults. \n\nYou can enter nearly all houses/buildings, in great contrast to many other similar games close to no door is locked in the Citadel  (ok, some doors are, but then you can unlock the door and enter). This is a real VR game, made from the ground up for PCVR. You can interact with most objects, physics work great. You can move chairs, lift barrels, light candles to light a dark room, and you can pick up most items:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986614016\n\nSure, Vertigo 2 still is the best game in 2023, but if you're into sword fighting, Undead Citadel may be the better choice. Note that the game is easy for Blade and Sorcery veterans, in that case choose the hardest level of difficulty. \n\nFor now 8/10 to me. 9/10 if latency on sword swinging is lowered.",

Got the royal edition on a steam sale for 12.00, and originally hated it, downloaded it, died about 30 times in the first 10 minutes of the game and deleted it considering it a wasted 12 dollars. A few months later i looked into it and found that you're supposed to be inept in the beginning and that you gradually get better as your character learns more moves. You may know what to do in a fight, but Henry is a Blacksmith's son, he doesn't. You arent special, or born to be great, you're a nobody.\n Redownloaded  and took my time to learn gameplay and practicing skills. Love it, the realism to the learning curve of combat and subtle additions like \"learning to read.\" Great game, I highly recommend it.",

HOWEVER, BE WARNED, THE GAME DOES REQUIRE YOU TO BE PATIENT WITH IT, you get to watch yourself and the protagonist slowly develop as a character and combatant as well as you develop in mechanics.\n\nFor a small studio I really do commend their work, I'm nowhere near European decent nor christian but I went to the game with an open mind and because I like history and do know a thing or two about medieval history  and was quite satisfied with it, the world and atmosphere are amazing, side quests and DLCs can keep the game up to 120hrs+ but after you finish those there is little to do in this game and you either start a new game or just quit and forget about it until the next time you open it. \n\nOverall I give this game a solid 8 out of 10 and I would recommend it.",

            "review": "Overall pretty fun game, interesting story, generally fun gameplay\na few gripes but not enough to stop me playing cause im enjoying the game overall\n\ncombat\nThe combat is a pain in the fucking ass. It can become more fun, once you grind up the combat levels to the point that no longer can every peasant with a rusty shovel master strike all of your hits and endlessly slap you in the face. The combat forces you to play EXTREMELY defensively, if you attack most of your hits will be parried or countered by whats referred to as a master strike, a counter that is unblockable. Once you get to higher levels you actually have a chance of being offensive and going after hits without all attacks being blocked or countered, but that will only be much later on in the game.\n\nStory\nThe story is pretty interesting, got me hooked quite quickly and a lot of the background characters are quite good, the vast majority seeming like real people and not just npcs there for the main quest. While it can be a pain in the ass that you didnt realise a quest was timed, actually having pressure to finish quests before you have negative consequences are pretty fun (by timed i mean you have like, a few in game days to complete them theres no 10 minute timers or whatever to finish a quest once you start it).\nMy main gripe with the story is just how much I dislike henry as a character, being a voiced main character with an actual story you're roughly meant to follow does mean that his character and choices are pretty limited to the person that henry is, but the problem is I dont really like henry all that much as a person. you can try your best to play honourable and be nice to people but at the end of the day henrys character is based around a slobish drunk thats massively hotheaded. More of a personal gripe than anything so you'd have to play for yourself and see how you like him but im still not the biggest fan, the amount he fucking wags his finger at people >:I\n\nbugs\nAh yes, its the modern day and almost all games come out in an unplayable state when several game breaking bugs for players to discover right after launch, good thing for you if you're reading this, its been a long time since this game launched. There are a few bugs in the game but most of them are minor, a small sidequest not giving you a small cash reward, one of the quests having a bugged speech check (you dont fail the quest but you do end up in jail for a short period, ive seen on the wiki that its claimed to be bugged so this isnt me just failing the speech check for magic reasons). But overall the game is pretty bug free so you shouldnt have any worries\n\nat the end of the day as stated at the start, overall a pretty good game and I recommend playing it",

            "review": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance is easily one of the best RPGs I've ever played. The story is fascinating in depth (not least because of the historical setting) and sprawling in scope.  The extensive non-combat options and open-ended quest solutions alongside the (initially awkward) difficult melee combat encourage diverse playstyles. Make no mistake. Kingdom Come: Deliverance is definitely a slow-burner. The main story itself takes a couple of hours before fully emerging. The various skills also require a good amount of practice before you're even close to mastery. The payoff is more than worth it, with all skills being extremely satisfying to pull off once mastered. \n\nThe locations feel alive and all the villages have their own distinctive feel. Traveling is a joy and the forests are simply breathtaking. They feel real and dense. There are picturesque places and they are not few and far between. This means that the game is not mindless traveling between activity/quest to activity/quest. Locations need to be revisited fairly frequently and the map is not terribly large. This turns out to be an advantage to the game, eschewing a focus on transport mechanics and instead developing lots of environmental interaction.\n\nThe artwork deserves a special mention for its intricate and informative inclusion. In the in-game murals, the loading screens, character screens, and the like, the artwork is detailed and immerses the player in the time and place. The Codex is a lovely addition, giving basic historical information on the main locations, characters, events, etc. The sound design is splendid with brilliant and immersive voice acting and very moving and memorable pieces in the soundtrack.\n\nThe central characters are well-fleshed out and ambiguous enough to feel human (and not a caricature). The DLCs add to the existing characters quite a bit (especially recommend A Woman's Lot and The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon) and the others are nice little additions (From the Ashes is a mini-city management quest). The only places where I can hope for improvement are the somewhat under-explored politics of the time (only emerging towards the end as the main character is finally politically entangled with Sigismund's invasion) and the slightly uniform nature of non-central NPCs. The Cumans are under-explored as characters (as almost no dialogue is possible, they become a caricature-like invading force of foreign mercenaries). More complex interactions with prominent non-Czech characters and non-combatant Czechs would be welcome.  Related to this is the slightly under-emphasized area of the role of non-combatant characters in the political struggle. Jan Hus' reformist ideas are on display in a key quest but the religious conflict of the time, especially premonitions of the Hussite war, feels somewhat diminished in the game.\n\nOther technical aspects like the bugs and rendering problems have been largely fixed, with only the occasional getting stuck in the gap between rocks and needing to fiddle with the jump button before getting out.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kingdom Come: Deliverance to any RPG fan, historical game fan, or even anyone wanting to play a highly immersive story. Warhorse, on the whole, has done a stellar job with this game. I am absolutely keeping my eye out for a sequel.",

            "review": "What this game is not:\nThis is not Assassin's Creed. The bad guys will not wait their turn and come at you one at a time. They will swarm you and they will EF you up.\nThis is not Shadow of Mordor. You are neither a trained military person, nor are you skilled at anything at the start. You cannot just run into a group of bad guys, spam the counter button, and kill everything (At least until you have leveled up significantly and have good equipment). The game will beat that fact into you with zero apologies.\nThis is not Skyrim. If you rush through the intro and then piss off into the world the second the game lets you then you will be wrecked by ANYONE who decides to attack you. Keep following the story quests at least until you learn blocks and parries.\nThis is not Just Cause. You cannot just run around causing mayhem. (Well, you CAN, but not if you want to get any of the story or really be able to do much of anything in any of the towns)\n\nWhat this game is:\nThis is a great time if you're willing to take the time to enjoy it. The game knows that it's not everyone's cup of tea and is 100% unapologetic about that. But if you take the game as it exists it will take you on one hell of a ride.\nThis is as complex as you're willing to let it be. You can beat the main story in as little as 2 hours and 5 minutes (Per Speedrun.com) or if you want to do all the side quests and DLC and take your time (like me) then you can spend hundreds of hours on a single play through.\n\nSome random advice about the game I wish I had been given before I started playing or that helped me greatly:\nSeriously, stick with the main story quest line until you unlock the weapons trainer in Rattay, and then IMMEDIATELY use him and learn blocks and parries and practice so you level up a bit and get a handle on the fighting mechanics. Fighting gets SO much easier after that.\nPick ALL the flowers you have the patience for at the start. There's a couple buffs and skills you can get from picking flowers that are Godsends in the early game. I wandered around Skalitz picking all the flowers and because I did that I left the intro area with a couple level ups, a few buffs, and all the potion material I would need for quite some time.\nBows are your friends in the early game (as long as you have armor for your forearms). You cannot touch anyone other than other nobodies when it comes to fighting at the start, so grab a bow (not a longbow) and some arrows and you can fire while backing away from the adversary. It's super easy to get head-shots doing this so you kill them faster and you end up with an achievement!\nI know, it's a medieval game, everyone wants to main a sword, but seriously; go with some form of a bonk-stick. (whether that's a mace, club, warhammer, etc. is up to you) Later in the game you WILL be facing people with serious armor and the bonk-sticks are great for making the bad guys take involuntary permanent naps; whereas you can nail an armored assailant several times with a sword and have little to no impact on their alive-ness.\nYou can get a dog really early on. I've heard it's of decent use in the early game. I wouldn't know because I wandered off into the world without following any of the quests that activated once I was out of the intro. The dog apparently can get in the way of being a sneaky-boi, so if that's your play-style maybe pass on the dog.\nSpeaking of dogs: take out any that are with your adversary. They will drain your ability to do jack and leave you helpless, so turn those puppers into pincushions without remorse.\nAlchemy: Learn it. Love it. You can make Saviour Schnapps (potions you need to save the game when you aren't close to a bed you own) which usually cost you in the neighborhood of 100 coins. Not a terrible price, but early on you don't want to be blowing all your money on that stuff.\nSpeaking of blowing money: Loot everything at the start. Any bad guy you kill should be stripped of everything of value early on. As soon as you have a horse you can just transfer stuff to the horse and not have to worry about the weight. Pick a town that will be your base of operations and sell everything you can to the local traders and merchants. Even if they have no money left to give you. They will turn around and sell everything they buy from you that they don't usually carry and then their funds will be higher so you can sell them more stuff then next time around. (It does reportedly take a couple days for this process to happen, I'm never in a town frequently enough to check) By the late game if you are doing this regularly you can have merchants and traders with purses in the 5 digit range, which makes stuff like the \"From the Ashes\" DLC easier as you will need a decent chunk of change for that.\n\nAnywho, I'm just rambling now, so I'm gonna shuddap.\nI think the game is worth the full price, but definitely pick it up if it goes on sale again with a decent discount.",

Gameplay wise lower difficulty always start or you will regret it all the way down(i know i started on normal) just bare with me climb up the ladder slowly.\n3rd person view is a good change of phase for Ethan. Shadow of rose is a very good DLC to bad its SHORT AF. I wish the dlc would be longer. NOW mercenaries.... well its mehh in general week.\nEthan as a character is more emotional then in RE7 that was more like a board (with out emotions) here he shows his emotions to the fullest good actor.\nRest i won't spoil but i don't like how Chris played his role due to cut content sooo... BLAH. \nCut content what i wanted is 3 way battle of Chris squads vs Lycans vs BSAA that would be rad but result was... meh....  some missing key characters \noverall 7.5 out of 10",

Excitement kinda plateaus after the dollhouse and never really recovers. The game is also quite railroaded and in my opinion lacked survival horror elements. It was more of an FPS with a thriller story attached.\n\nIf you're okay with that then you'll probably have a decent amount of fun, so I will recommend it. Otherwise check out different RE games instead of this",

What's more, with this instalment being more action oriented, there is a plethora of weapon unlocks this time that will give quite the replayability (4 times for me!).",

The card, which gives a price as to whether the room has been completely looted or not, is particularly helpful.\n\nThe story and the artistic direction are excellent. The game itself is very innovative and provides a real renewal. Although the game is easier than its predecessor, the exploration, zone unlocking, and puzzle systems are excellent. The DLCs are also successful and fun. The bonus shop with the expansions and benefits that can be unlocked and purchased through successes has also been implemented well.\n\nIn summary, it's one of the best Resident Evil games for me, especially in terms of gameplay. So I recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent survival horror with enough modernity and around 15-20 hours of gameplay.\n\nI can definitely give the game a buy recommendation.",

So many random question markers on screen filled with not so good rewards for completing them.\n\nThe Main characters Bayek of Siwa and Aya were well written and portrayed neatly, shame it all led to mediocre ending.Game might be worth for some who like grinding for XP and ability points, but for the ones who do not have a lot of leisure time, its just not worth it.",

            "review": "I have really mixed feelings about this game. I accidentally AC Odyssey first instead of this. News flash I liked Odyssey so the experience this game was supposed to make me feel was kind of taken away by that. It is a massive game. Almost too big for my liking. I know Odyssey isn't apart of this game, but I'll try not to compare it too much. Overall it very beautiful game. You do need a decent pc to run it. I have 3070 so I didn't have a problem running it at 1440p ultra settings. If you want a framerate around 60-80fps. I would recommend turning volumetric clouds if you have 3070. That is it. Anything below a 3070 like 3060 you can run at 1440p but you gotta lower the settings. Or you can play 1080p ultra settings no problem on 3060. Anything lower try to see what works best. In terms of overall Assassins Creed feeling, it is very absent in terms of past games. You have a wide array of weapons and you don't even get the assassin blade until you are well into the story. The game completely shys away from stealth. This only you really need to use stealth is when the enemies are slightly overpowered, but even then I almost used a bow 95% of the time. Speaking of weapons if you bought the highest edition you have given legendary weapons at the start. They are very helpful. I played through 75% of the game with the poison shield and sword and the flame bow. The rest of the loot is almost pointless and you never use it. Once you use the weapons you like you almost will never change it, which makes looting the chests and stuff completely pointless. But selling the weapons and scrapping the blue weapons give you the materials and money need to upgrade the weapons you want.\n\nI completed every side quest and marker on the map. However the achievement for that has not popped up which sucks. Unlike past games you cannot see what you have completed which is really frustrating. There are some pretty useless regions with only 2-6 different things in each. 3 of them being deserts, and 2 of them being oceans. They are just bloat for the game to make it look big. Those same areas have barely any synchronization points so you can't fast travel to them. There 75 synchronization points in the game total with the dlc. That should give a decent gauge on big the game. The statues you have to destroy don't give you anything. The papyrus puzzles I did not do because there so many and you mainly go off of clues. The races are the most frustrating pieces of garbage in this entire game. They are not worth playing at all. Besides the races, I have done everything. There are well 170 quests in this entire game. The side quests barely add to the story at all. You can completely skip them if you want, but the game forces you to do them so you level up to move on through the story and the regions. \n\nLeveling up in this game is an egregious chore. Going from place to place, doing this, doing that. It really sucks the fun out of the game. With Odyssey many of the side quests actually contributed to the main story. \nSpeaking of story it is barely there. You have the main plot driver, but as travel around you often forget what the next part of the story you have to do, because you have level up.  I wanted to see what the whole experience would be like if I did just about everything. News flash you don't have to do everything. I bought on this sale for $20 for the whole game and dlc. I have over 70 hours in the game I think the purchase was worth it. If you want a game that will last you a long time the mythology assassins creed games will do the job. Would I recommend you playing all the through without playing other games, absolutely not. Youll get why I call open world exhaustion. Sometimes there is so much in this game that is mostly bloat quests and stuff you often get bored very quickly. Play this game in increments so you have the motivation to actually complete the game. \n\nFor the dlc, the story is actually better than the base game. I like the curse of the pharaohs a lot more. You have different worlds so to speak once you get into the dlc. It is easily my favorite part of the entire game. It actually dives into a lot more history and the mythology of Egypt. Don't buy the dlc at full price. Its about 3-4 hours for each dlc for me completing everything to give you a gauge on how long it will take. I won't say too much more about the dlc as they do take place after the main story. \n\nThe Origin of the Order is actually more fascinating and interesting than origin of the assassins which is kind of sad. That was also one of my favorite parts of the game. The origin of the order is so cool and fascinating I feel most AC fans will enjoy it. I bought all the AC games back in 2019. I finished Odyssey about 2 years ago. I have not played a AC game for quite some time. I recommend playing the mythology games spaced out as again you will get open world exhaustion. The outfits are kind of cool I ended up wearing the same one throughout the game until I completed the constellation quest and collected enough silica from the tombs. The outfit for that is the coolest in the entire game to me. I recommend you do. Quick tip collect as much silica as you can from every tomb and area if you want it. \n\nOverall this game was okay. I liked Odyssey much more everything is more refined from this game. But I do recommend it for those who like AC or open world games.",

            "review": "TL DR: This is the most ubisoft game of all time. It was fun at some points, Desert world was done well and story was intriguing at some points. BUT THE GRIND IS SO BORING AND THEY LEVEL LOCK QUESTS. The game could have been 15 hours shorter and still would have had the same impact. All around 7/10. \n\nThis is the turning point for the assassins creed franchaise. The change from solely assassination game play with stealth is now an RPG which happens to have a stealth system in it where you can insta-kill unaware soldiers. The focus was shifted into a more combat oriented camp clearing, fast travel point collecting, skill point spending game which is just completely ubisoft. Its comparable with Farcry which does the same thing but with guns. Assassins creed odyssey completely leans into that and is more extreme with it. \n\nSaying this I really enjoyed some moments. Here are some of the more positive aspects. \nHunting animals, exploring tombs, running around on my camel exploring areas. It was all fun. Climbing up the pyramids of Giza felt amazing and some of the views of the map are stunning. Especially when most of the view is just desert. Some NPCs are fun to talk to and it is simply satisfying when you assassinate someone. The music when roaming the desert really fits the vibe as well. If it had been just that and it wasnt an RPG it would have been an easy 9/10\n\nAfter a while however, there is nothing added onto the game. It become repetitive, grinding side quests so that you can do the next story mission. Slowly and ineffectively going through camps which give you just enough EXP to make it feel like you are sort of progressing. After the 20 hour mark I just was thinking of playing other, more engaging games. It just became a chore and I wanted it to be done as fast as possible. Something I never felt when playing something like black flag.\n\nThe main reason behind this is the damn level requirements on the mission. Sure, it says \"Recommended level\" but in reality if you aren't at least within 2 levels of that number you will not be able to realistically beat the missions. You will do 20 damage when you would regularly do 100. This creates a sort of grind that becomes super repetitive. Get mission, talk to NPC, go to encampment, kill people, save hostage, free hostage. They are all a variation of that. For the first few times they are alright but not fun. Even over world enemies become difficult to kill too. \n\nIt is such a shame to see an amazing game be fucked by the forced level requirements. I would still recommend just be prepared for a grind.\n\n",

There is absolutely nothing else this game does differently and is repetitive. The story line is boring, the characters are forgettable and the mission suck - they've tried to copy what the Witcher does but have failed miserably. \n\nI don't understand how this series got to where it is right now! If you remember the earlier AC games, there were missions in which we had to fly around Venice and drive tanks! What happened to all that cool stuff? All the missions in this game are boring and you have to do the same thing over and over again. I should have stuck to my resolution of staying off Ubisoft games - they just recycle their sterile games and Origins proves it.  \n\nThey need to add a few gamers in the development team as it feels like the developers are not gamers and don't know what a fun game is supposed to be. Picked this up on sale as everyone said there were some changes in Origins but if you like me have been playing AC games for a long time, skip this one and devote your time to something else. I finished it and can safely say that it sucks. If you have the itch to play an AC game, best to go back and play the older ones like AC 2, Brotherhood or Blackflag.",

            "review": "A review I watched lamented that this game \"felt as if Assassin's Creed might've lost its soul\". Frankly, I'm glad. Of the three AC games I've played, this was by far the best and has been a blast to play. The franchise has reinvented itself as an RPG (with clear influence from The Witcher 3) and it's leagues more immersive and engaging as a result. Ptolemaic Egypt is fascinating and beautiful, Bayek has genuine charisma and wit, and the leveling system and skill trees are sensible and genuinely rewarding. Combat is much more sophisticated than older games with all manner of weapons, special attacks, parries, blocking, dodging, and all sorts of tricks that you'd expect any self-respecting combat savvy medjay to have. The story is a bit haphazard as AC often is, but there's a merciful lack of mentions of Assassins or Templars, as well as very few Abstergo-related scenes (which felt like a blessing coming from Black Flag). The world is huge, pretty, and full of things to do that manage to strike just the right note of not feeling [i]too[/i] tedious while still letting you grind if you want.\n\nA word of warning: I spent an UNGODLY amount of time debugging this game, though I have one of the new Intel GPUs that's a bit more prone to driver problems than more conventional offerings. If you've got problems, you may want to look into using 'dxvk' if you're on AMD/Intel cards, or rolling back your drivers if you're on Nvidia cards. I've crashed the game DOZENS of times simply by diving into water, so buyer beware.\n\nIf you can get past the technical and performance problems, this game is a ton of fun and a breath of fresh air from an otherwise soul-crushingly formulaic and monotonous franchise. As crazy as it feels to say, I'm actually looking forward to playing the next one.",

            "review": "Psychonauts 2 is a decently fun game, but not without its flaws.\n\nA good word to describe Psychonauts 2 would be \"overproduced\". The cutscenes, dialogue, and even animations of interacting with the environment can be fun, but often overstay their welcome. To give one example I remember pressing a button to solve a puzzle involved: Animation of approaching the control panel -> Dialogue option to give more button choices -> Dialogue to select a button -> Dialogue to go back to initial menu -> Dialogue to exit the control panel. And if you want to press another button you have to do the entire thing over again. It's just tedious and makes the game seem reluctant to even let the player play it.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, it's decent overall. You unlock a few new powers which are a mix of fun and underwhelming. The levels are creative aesthetically but are largely the same in terms of how they play out [Platforming] -> [Fighting] -> [Platforming] -> [Occasional puzzle] -> [Platforming], which is quite disappointing considering the gameplay variety potential for the premise of every level.\n\nAll things considered I had fun with Psychonauts 2, It's a creative game with a fun world and characters. I just wish the developers focused a bit more on the \"game\" part.",

While I had a little trouble finding a button layout for the 8 psychic powers available that let me develop muscle memory, the enemy variety, especially later in the game, makes use of each power in most fights.\nThe story is pretty light, but I loved watching these characters in cutscenes and by the end I was invested in some of them. When I started playing, I was worried that Raz's voice would get annoying, but instead it steadily grew on me.\nThe collectathon gameplay loop on paper sounds tedious, but while it's extremely satisfying to get all of the *whatevers*, the game also lets you know early on that you can leave some for later if you can't get to them immediately. There is plenty I still haven't gotten yet, and I doubt I will have 100% this game by the time I move on.\nWhile I have finished the main story (and the 35 minute credit sequence), I have no intention of leaving this game behind just yet. It is just too precious.",

I can say that the gameplay of the game is perfect compared to the first version and that the experience of the world of Psychonauts with today's visual graphics was enjoyable.\n\nThe game environments this time seemed wider and more alive and more beautiful، the background music of the game was very enjoyable and had a good variety.\n\nThe story of the game has become more serious and deeper, at first glance it may seem like a cool platforming game like other games, but the story of the game is extremely serious. I enjoyed the experience of Psychonauts 2 more than the first version and I recommend it to everyone.\n\nScore 10/10",

Gunshots don't register, suppressed shots pull every zombie with a 20 km radius. Zombie path finding is absurd, you run through the woods, through 15 buildings across a river and over a mountain and the zombie chasing you is on your ass and not even broken a sweat. Loot spawn sucks. You get hungry / die of starvation way too quickly. Trying to constantly repair your gear sucks. Weapons break after 5 swings/shots. Sickness sucks, in the \"cold\" for 2 seconds? Fatally ill. The new sprain/broken leg system sucks, get hit by one zombie? Broken leg, wince and blurred screen with every step. Oh and good f**king luck finding a vehicle.\n\nGame is just laborious.  After all this time they've made it prettier, it gets good frame rates. But what does it matter when the core game is still ass.",

            "review": "This WOULD be a good game - but this is where the Steam review system fails because you can't \"rate\" the game.  You have to give it a 100% thumbs up or a 100% thumbs down when most opinions should be a 1-10 rating or even a percentile number.  This \"social media\" crap forces people to give carte blanche  \"likes\"  to games in a black and white manner - Steam ought to be ashamed of itself for being so sophomoric in its rating system.\n\nI WOULD give this game around a 75% approval.  \n\nBut the devs ruined the game with cold snaps.  I hate cold snaps so much that I probably won't ever play this game again unless there is an option to disable them.  \n\nI've been playing computer games since there WERE computer games back in the 70s.  And I can safely say that cold snaps in this game are easily within the top 5 WORST things I've ever seen in a game.  Not because cold snaps are difficult - because there's nothing you can do about them.  Which is why they suck so much. \n\nEssentially, getting a cold snap means you put the game on maximum speed - then you go do something else for half an hour.  Go have some sex.  Make some food.  Walk the dog.  Go call your mom.  But you won't be playing the game.  Because there's nothing you can do.  \n\nYour settlers will just keel over unconscious the moment they go outside.  You're liable to have almost every last settler lying around outside.  You can easily lose your entire village through this stupidity.  \n\nAll you can do is take your hands off your keyboard, off your mouse - and hope the AI doesn't get all of your settlers killed.  Because YOU no longer matter.  The game may as well play itself.  \n\nUntil the devs fix the utter stupid trash that are cold snaps, the game isn't really worth playing unless you just like torturing yourself.  I'm not saying that cold snaps are impossible to survive - no you can survive them.  It's just a question of whether its really worth your time.  For me, I'd rather being playing a game that doesn't try to kill your settlers for doing nothing more than leaving their goddamn houses.   \n\nI'm only giving this game a \"thumbs up\"  because Steam hasn't figured out yet that games are too complicated and subjective to saddle the players with an \"all or nothing\" review system.  Reviewing a game shouldn't be as banal and vapid as \"liking\" a kitten video - but apparently Steam thinks that you either LIKE a game 100% or HATE a game 100%.",

            "review": "First off, I'd like to mention that I've been with GM since near the beginning. I've seen it from the start, and I feel like it's been going in a direction I didn't expect nor buy the game in \"early access\" for. Second, this is NOT a castle-building game. This is a sim game and is only becoming more and more of one. There aren't any Castle type of structures. You can *build* a Castle, but it won't really look like one. None of that has changed since the beginning; although, they did add ladders somewhat recently, but the main focus has been on quality of life stuff, and more ways to micro-manage processes and your villagers.\n\n    I've waited for long stints hoping the broken stuff would be fixed after the wait, or new things would be added, but it never was. It's been several years, and yes, they've added new things, but the original stuff is still broken. Settler pathing, building, hauling, and anything really is so broken that you can't just get to a point and sit back to watch a masterpiece or job well done. It requires constant over-watch and management, and only more of that has been added with stuff like the \"quality of life\" update where you have to pay attention to how the settlers feel about each other, themselves, or their work/living space. It's becoming so tedious and micro-managing that it's a chore. It takes so long to get anything substantial done because everything you do is a grind that takes even longer than it should because the AI is so broken. \n\n    Some problems with this non-strategy game is that the AI is still as broken as ever. They have to work so much on it, that you won't get a lot of new stuff except for every now and then. The AI will build themselves in when building layers of wall so badly that you have to be strategic with how you build whenever you want something fairly thick or more than one story off the ground. I've had settlers get stuck in the corner because they built the walls around it, and they can't travel diagonally like that; thus, you have to constantly oversee and micromanage, adding only a few blueprints at a time. Yeah, you can build some \"pretty cool looking-stuff,\" but your options are disparagingly small. There is also a limit to how high you can go, so if you were wanting to replicate some tall buildings, you either can't, or you'll have to not build it to scale. \n\n   If you're into sims, you might like this, but like I said, the AI is broken. Furthermore, much of the player-base has gotten sentimental with the animals and everything else, so they want to have item after item for them, or they want to add more ways to micromanage. I really don't know what the devs want in the end, but it does seem like they're going for a full on sim. Either way, it will take a very long time for them to even get to the end of their \"road-map\" of things that they plan to add as main parts of the game. \n\n     The combat is another somewhat broken thing. I've heard people complain about settlers not moving when commanded, and that can get them killed. The enemy isn't overpowered at all, but they have \"moving trebuchets\", that wreck your hard work very easily, and they have no counter. Some of the player base don't want the player to have stuff either because then it would be even easier to cheese combat than it is now, but combat currently is just this really tedious thing where archers are supreme. By the way Foxy Voxel, trebuchets Don't move! Those are catapults. Thank you! \n\nBottom-line. If you want a castle-building game that isn't a sim, then don't buy the game. If you like sims, you may like this, but it's currently broken, so I'd recommend waiting or getting it on sale. I kind of wish I could recommend the game because the devs do seem to be working hard on it, but I can't because it's broken, you'll get bored fast, and it's not my cup of tea. I actually regret getting it because it wasn't actually fun.",

First, the \"early access\" tag is not a valid excuse for the plethora of issues still plaguing the game. The point of the tag is to allow devs with a functional prototype (i.e. a working product in alpha or beta) to generate additional revenue to finish the initial full release of a game. See Baldur's Gate III for a good example of a valid \"early access\" title.\n\nSecond, the roadmap is not a valid excuse for lack of core mechanics. It's rather unfortunate and frustrating the trend developers seem to follow by including their core mechanics in a \"roadmap\" as a method for enticing players to stick around after making an initial purchase. A roadmap is intended to - as the name suggests - map out planned features that are not critical to the base value and functionality of the game.\n\nThe review will be in bullet format to properly express my thoughts without unnecessary fluff text.

Hunting is even worse with pawns constantly needing to reacquire their target.\n[*]Combat - Pawns have ~0.5s delay between executing commands\n[*]Temperature - Multi-story buildings turn into saunas during the summer (noted by devs)\n[*]Pathing/Spawning - The game regularly fails to check whether there are valid paths from the edge of the map to the settlement before spawning events\n[*]Pathing/Jobs - Pawns will still routinely get stuck in holes if given a blanket mine command\n[*]Building/Priority - Pawns will build multi-story buildings in a seemingly random order rather than layer by layer despite sufficient stability (results in longer than average build times)\n[*]Building/Construction - Cannon replace already constructed components, the player must first deconstruct and then construct the new/upgraded component\n[*]Attributes Tab - Messy UI design that conveys critical information about pawns into a tiny window in one blob\n[*]Settings/Configuration - Lack of control over storytelling aspects alongside missing keybind options\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\nDespite the overall critical review, Going Medieval is groundbreaking in other aspects.\n\n[list]\n[*]Building System is implemented well and functions without any issues or frustration\n[*]Ability to change the aesthetic of already placed components\n[*]Seamless connections between build pieces\n[*]16 layer build height with half steps to provide easier navigation between layers\n[*]6 levels of job priorities that allow for precise pawn management\n[*]Complex attributes system - similar to Rimworld - that introduces a level of complexity to gameplay which feels natural\n[*]Control over pawns' attire, meals, and drug usage policies\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nGoing Medieval started off as a clone of RimWorld with the z-levels mod, but lacked most of the features RimWorld has. However, it's both unfair and dishonest to make the claim that Going Medieval is a RimWorld clone as the game has progressed to a point where the two are artistically and functionally different. Some UI elements still exist that are direct rips from RimWorld (namely the job priorities tab), but core features seem to implement entirely unique approaches that are non-existent in base RimWorld.\n\nDespite everything that has been implemented so far, Going Medieval is vastly overpriced for the amount of gameplay it offers with lack of any kind of modding support. After 2 or 3 playthroughs, most scenarios will start to feel repetitive as you repeat much of the same gameplay elements with almost no variation whatsoever. The harsh reality is that the publisher is selling a $15 USD game for $25 USD while hiding behind the \"early access\" title to shield themselves from proper criticisms.\n\nThe only time I can recommend buying this game is if it goes on sale for 50% off, at least until the current roadmap is filled out.",

            "review": "Despite playing for a couple hours and rather enjoying myself, I can't comfortably recommend this game. It's not bad by any means and if you like a relatively calm and slow game, this may be for you. This review is written by someone that played games like Farthest Frontier, Oxygen Not Included and many tower defense games. With an initial look, this game seems perfect for someone like me.\n\nFour things, however, killed the game for me : lack of depht, odd progression, micromanagement hell and bugs. Oh yes, bugs. Now, the last one is to be expected from a game on Early Access, so I'd be fine with starting a new game and trying it all over again (which I did plenty of times in Oxygen Not Included). But the first three were quite impactful.\n\nFirst, the game is quite simple. You collect some resources, put together a couple buildings and then repeat. And then if the gods are feeling particularly spiteful that day, you may get a looter attack. That's it. Coming from games in which you have to establish gathering and production chains, this feels quite different. Not bad, but it's something to be noted. What more could be added? More variety in attacking forces, more natural events, resource nodes on the map that encourage building further from the initial point, and so on.\n\nSecond, the game lacks meaningful progression. In games like these, I feel like the idea of \"ages\" is a good concept. Make researches that are more meaningful, and that unlock more side researches. Add interesting names to them, and make it so that they actually unlock something new, rather than just making it so that you can craft yourself something that was already available. In short, it feels like the progression of the game just isn't there. You start with few citizens, and that barely changes (and depending on your choices it doesn't, which can be a good thing if you want a small village). You start with pretty much no weapons, and after many researches you can put together the same kind of weapons you get from looters from early days. Even after hunting for years, the same villager misses 90% of their attacks, and so on. The game needs to have more flashy progression. And having to recover \"lost knowledge\" is awful. I get it, but it's an awful mechanic.\n\nAnd lastly, micromanagemnt. I understand that making settlers \"smart\" is hard and subjective. But they feel immensively helpless. Some improvements would be : get the closest material, not ANY available material. Please. There are always going to be many different materials sources, since settlers seem to not care about carrying the materials they just harvested to a centralized warehouse. And also, make hunters smarter. I quit the game after having to every day manually select which animal to hunt. It's painful. Add a system in which they search for prey. It's the bare minimum.\n\nTo finalize, the game's idea is wonderful. I don't want to make it seem like this is a bad game. It's lovely and it's something I'll keep an eye on. And I had fun, quite a bit. If the game improves on those aspects, I'll come back, and even change the review. But for now, I don't recommend the game.",

But the cellar had to be with dirt walls and twig floor, because of the random set heat isolation factors:\nWalls: dirt 0%, wood 60% , clay 93%,stone 70% and stonebricks 75%\nFloors: dirt 0% (but pushes rotting), wood 94%, twigs 40%, stone 70% and stonebricks 90% \nBuildingactions: your settlers often fix themselves in a wall or digging all fields arround them and than starve on their created \"Pile of idiocracy\". I don´t wanna know how often they will burn themselves to ashes, when the feature gets implemented^^\nterraforming: there often spawn some resources from digging through vains. and the settlers often dig from above. when the mats are spawning in the hole, and there is no path on the same ground lvl. Now you have to build a ramp or a pathway, to get the stuff away from there, because it blocks the filling of the hole. \nTasks: the settlers have only a small amount of \"task-categories\". So \"cooking\" means foodmaking, butchering, fermentation, smoking. But often your dead animals rots to pieces and you have no food, because high chief Jolanda is running thrugh the whole map to pick up some berries to make wine^^\n\nI was really sad after I realized, how often I had to fix stupid behavior of my settlers. \nBut maybe, I just have to high expectations, because of my expierience of (modded) rimworld. I hope. the ultimate castle building/settlement simulator of my dreams will come true, when I test it aggain in a few months.

            "review": "One of the first novelties in Assassin's Creed: Syndicate is precisely the duo of protagonists, Jacob and Evie Frye. Brother and sister are introduced to us as already initiated into the ranks of the Assassins, thus sparing tedious prologues and investing precious time in characterization that is all in all well done, and, above all, functional in context. Although undoubtedly stereotypical - impulsive and restless he, more thoughtful and pragmatic she - the two embody very well the two souls of the proposed gameplay, and above all they live a relationship based on an entertaining chemistry of constant bickering and contrasts. The plot pits them against an insane and idealistic Templar, who is convinced that he can turn London into a \"paradise\" by settling internal turmoil with violence and exploiting the flourishing of industry to subjugate the souls. The atmosphere is fascinating, and in its own way (fanta)historically convincing, although the chain of events leading up to the finale has no particular twists. What works more than anything else is the characterization of the individual characters, which also goes to include historical figures of the period, including Dickens, Darwin, Marx, and Queen Victoria. Although the latter's are only unlocked once the story is completed, this quartet of characters (reproduced with particular verve and a touch of humor) will ensure a good overall number of \"memories\" to be experienced parallel to the nine sequences of the main campaign, providing a nice cross-section of London at the height of industrialization. So if the validity of the glimpse was already confirmed from the first appearances of the game, what is striking is the excellent characterization work done on the historical moment, narrated on the streets of a city that at the time really represented \"the center of the world.\" The gangs, the cultural, technological and political restlessness, the unstoppable expansionism. An industrious empire but also full of contrasts, between the first technological marvels and the brutality of the slums. The good reproduction is complemented by a thorough level design work, offering interesting paths to exploit through traditional parkour: as for the latter, compared to Unity there is an improvement in the fluidity of the animations and in the recognition of the controls, with a latching on to the handholds that still generates some headaches in some frantic moments, but it rediscovers itself to be more accurate.\nThe two separate buttons for ascent and descent, to which moreover we have become accustomed by now, return, flanked by a brand new feature, namely the grappling hook. The latter can be used either to rise in a matter of seconds or to stretch a rope between two points so that it can be used to move quickly from one building to another. Although it makes the task easier when it comes to escaping from enemy alerts, the tool proves to be a lot of fun to use during the action, and it alternates very naturally with the",

            "review": "Syndicate betrays more traditional AC elements than it is loyal to. Jacob and Evie are already assassins when we meet them, so it’s not an origin story like Black Flag or Unity. Even so, their immaturity is reminiscent of those very games. \n\nThe game allows you to play as both Jacob and Evie, to alternate between them outside and during some missions. I like that they aren’t just the same character gameplay wise, Jacob specialises in combat, while Evie in stealth, but Jacob is annoying. Unfortunately, for some reason, the game wants you to play as Jacob more and towards the end, most main missions are played as him. Evie deserves more screen time. The romance between Evie and Henry would have been acceptable if not for its lazy writing.\n\nSyndicate’s Victorian London matches Unity’s Revolutionary Paris in attention to detail. However, unlike Paris, London’s tone is less on inequality between classes and more on how it was just a horrible place to live in in general. The city is monotonous enough that this message is successfully conveyed, yet has enough depth to make it interesting. The sky is polluted with smoke from factories in which children work and crime is rampant, yet through enough exploration, you’ll find people playing cricket, kids playing football, and couples taking photos. The game manages to draw a city so depressing and lifeless yet so immersive and full of life, and it looks incredible. Its size can be intimidating though, I found myself fast travelling a lot compared to in Unity.\n\nHowever, London is not fit for parkour. Its buildings are too far apart and its streets are too wide. Without the rope launcher, which doesn’t even work right half the time, it would be impossible to traverse through usual AC means. At the same time, the rope launcher also takes away from the parkour experience. Other than that, parkour is further simplified and doesn’t have the same charm as its predecessor. Carriages give life to the city, and are nice to ride recreationally, but not very functional in chases and carriage-fights. \n\nI have mixed feelings about the combat. It looks amazing; the violent successive punches, cuts, stabs and revolver shots as well as the brass knuckles, cane-swords and kukri fit perfectly with the setting of Victorian London. My problem with it is there seems to be no rhythm to it. I don’t know how long it’s going to take to kill an enemy, or how many hits it takes to deal damage to an enemy. Other than that, I didn’t have a problem with the levelling system or the skill tree. Stealth is improved. The kidnapping mechanic is fun, albeit unrealistic.\n\nMy biggest gripe is how the game doesn't take itself seriously. What could be important and emotionally heavy scenes are often interrupted by bad jokes, both in the historical setting and modern-day. There’s little emotional connection between the twins and the story, the missions, or the city and that reduces the gravity of the story the game is trying to tell. We know that their father was an assassin operating in London, but all the game does with his character is use him as argument fuel between the twins, and the game completely forgot about George, whose orders the twins defy in the first place to end up in London. The game just doesn’t feel like a main AC game.\n\nSyndicate isn’t a bad game, but is definitely the worst AC game I’ve played so far. \n\n5/10",

Doing all open world activities first, then doing the story kept me more engaged in the story but the pacing completely fell apart. The game does not do enough to guide players through tasks.\n\nRegardless, the story is strong, despite the modern-era stuff, and the gameplay is pretty solid too. It took a while to get used to having 2 characters, but once you get the hang of it, the extra character really helps add variety into otherwise well-worn gameplay systems.",

            "review": "[h1][b]\"Resident Evil 7: A Heart-Pounding Nightmare That Keeps Me Hooked... I am still playing!\"[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Resident Evil 7 isn't just a game; it's an adrenaline-fueled descent into sheer horror that consumes my every waking moment. From the second I stepped foot into the dilapidated Baker estate, I knew I was in for an experience unlike any other. Gripped by fear and curiosity, I embarked on a journey that continues to haunt my dreams and captivate my gaming soul... and yes, I am still playing.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974281419\n[b]The atmosphere in Resident Evil 7 is nothing short of masterful. The developers have artfully crafted a world that oozes with a palpable sense of dread. Every creaking floorboard, flickering light, and distant moan sends shivers down my spine. The game's first-person perspective immerses me in a waking nightmare, with each corner I turn and every door I open becoming a nerve-wracking gamble. The attention to detail is astounding, making every nook and cranny feel both fascinating and terrifying.[/b]\n\n[b]As I traverse the twisted corridors of the Baker estate, the gameplay mechanics keep me on the edge of my seat. The limited resources and strategic decision-making elevate the tension to unprecedented heights. Every bullet counts, every herb found is a lifeline, and every puzzle solved brings a sigh of relief. The combat mechanics strike a perfect balance between vulnerability and empowerment, as I desperately fight for survival against the grotesque creatures that lurk in the shadows. It's a heart-pounding dance between life and death that never fails to get my adrenaline pumping.[/b]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2135401408\n[b]Resident Evil 7's narrative is a captivating nightmare that gradually unravels with each blood-soaked discovery. The tale of the Baker family and the mysterious infection that plagues them is a chilling descent into madness and desperation. The game's slow-burning suspense and shocking plot twists keep me constantly engaged, desperate to uncover the truth while dreading what awaits me around the next corner. The hauntingly atmospheric audio design and chilling performances by the voice actors further enhance the immersive experience, making me feel like I'm living the nightmare alongside the characters.[/b]\n\n[b]But what truly sets Resident Evil 7 apart is its commitment to reinventing the franchise while staying true to its roots. The shift to a first-person perspective breathes new life into the series, giving it a fresh and intimate perspective. It's a bold departure that pays off in spades, reinvigorating the Resident Evil formula and delivering a game that's equal parts homage and innovation.[/b]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2133912249\n[b]It's worth mentioning that I am still playing Resident Evil 7 because of its outstanding replayability. The game offers multiple difficulty levels, unlockable secrets, and alternative paths to explore. Each playthrough feels distinct, offering new challenges and surprises, ensuring that even after the initial fear subsides, I keep coming back for more. It's a testament to the game's quality and the developers' commitment to delivering a truly immersive and lasting experience.[/b]\n\n[b][i]Resident Evil 7 is a harrowing journey into the depths of terror, an experience that grips me tightly and refuses to let go. Its atmospheric brilliance, intense gameplay, and captivating narrative make it a must-play for any horror enthusiast. So join me in the darkness, if you dare, and let Resident Evil 7 consume your soul. Believe me, you'll be playing it long after the lights go out.[/i][/b]",

            "review": "[h1] Review[/h1] \nA lot of people felt that Resident Evil lost its touch. Especially with 5-6 and somewhat 4. For me each game in the mainline franchise felt so completely different, maybe aside 1 and 2, from each other that its hard to say you have to specifically do it like that. While I loved 6 and every mainline Resident Evil game so far in general: This game is a right step into the correct direction for such a game. There aren’t many high quality, bestselling proper horror games out there that aren’t walking simulators.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nCapcom took a few core elements of what the main franchise mainly consists of and what people might want or wanted to see in a modern horror game. So, the game is set this time not in a mansion but a relatively large countryside house, together with a guest house and an old structure and then some. It’s a really impressive and most of all; credible place I found myself lost in quickly.\n\nAdditionally, they took the franchises puzzle nature and adapted it. I always like this, combining and using items at the correct spot or finding a key that opens up new places or shortcuts. Especially if the game makes you feel smart or gives you an endorphin rush when you find an item you need to proceed further.\nCombining the place and the puzzles makes for a relatively twisted horror house scenario, with weird switches, keys and traps around. There are items to find and craft into items you currently want and need or secrets to find in every corner. Exploration is very fun, although after some time a bit tedious due to the main characters relatively low movement speed coupled together with the amount of backtracking. Which isn’t bad but the amount was slightly too much.\n\nThe games switch towards a first person perspective is a welcome one, not that I prefer any perspective over the other. I just like variety. Combat itself is fun due to the very strong enemies and very weak main character. You can also block do reduce a lot of incoming damage. Enemy variety is rather mediocre, there are in total 4 enemy types and a couple of different bosses or bossfights which are the highlight for me in this game. There are more unique bossfights than regular enemies. \n\nIn general, the game is highly enjoyable and entertained me from start to finish. There is an infamous section on the boat, mostly because it gives you a relatively weak weapon to fight off enemies and it becomes way much more linear and combat focused compared to the beginning of the game. And the game has the perfect length. A first playthrough will take you from 7-10 hours, a second or third less than 3-5 hours. I especially like how on the unlockable madhouse difficulty not only collectible coins are replaced, but also different items are there to find. An annoying factor is that you cannot skip cutscenes.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nInitially It has absolutely nothing to do with Resident Evil. I feared that it might be a complete reboot, completely disregarding the franchise earlier games but the ending connects it towards it while also hinting for a new game.\n\nThe basic idea is that the main characters girlfriend disappeared and he gets an anonymous letter where to find here. When being at the place it turns into a 90s horror flick, hillbilly mad people with somewhat inhumane powers. \n\nThere is also two endings but only one is canon as the non canon one just absolutely makes no sense whatsoever.\n\n[u]Sound[/u]\nI always respect it if someone translates and dubs games in a lot of different languages. Capcom always did this and I always appreciate it. Additionally, the soundtrack is barely noticeable. Most of the time you have only environmental sounds. Even the save room theme is barely noticeable. But i liked that they didn't use a mute main protagonist which i don't really like, especially nice that Ethan is a likeable guy.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nThe game is overly reliant on various filter. These fit to the game especially in the baker property although I can understand why people might dislike the vignette effect that is ramped so much in this game that it became an artstyle choice almost. Atleast the colours aren’t completely undersaturated which is something I absolutely dislike. What I really love are the various small animations the game does when you use an object like cutting the chain or healing.\n\nCharacter models are rather uncanny which is basically the only type of game where that makes sense to have. Additionally, the game can be tweaked a lot, making it look very great but can also run on any potato. I only disliked the general art direction of the enemies, just black humanoid blops.\n\n[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]\nGame does everything right a horror game should do. A neat setting where the main character actually feels dread and is constantly under suspense. Graphics and style choice are great and the game runs really good. Combat is fun and especially the exploration and interconnectivity of the whole baker property is something I really love. Crafting is also a neat and welcome addition. Although I’m not really a fan of the common enemy type opposed to the really awesome boss battles. Also, during the very lategame the game turns rather linear and is more action focused.\n\n8/10 Great game\n",

The characters played their part so well, and it felt extremely on point. \nI loved the main story, as well as every single DLC. It felt so good to have a DLC / mode for every character and made it so different, unique and complete. I think Capcom really did a great job with RE7! \n\nI didn't like how Chris Redfield looked in this game, visually, since it's different from the rest of the games, but it didn't bother me that much since he's a special character which will always be loved and appreciated.\n\nOverall it took me 35h to 100% the game, but despite that, I will still come back to play it some more! Have fun and good luck!\n\nP.S: O'Brian finally released his novel and the Bakers had it in their house. That was so nice to see!",

I liked all of the parts of it up until the salt mine. Gameplay with Mia was a nice twist and everything tha came before it waas fantastic. The salt ine felt extremely like filler content tho. And while the final reveal, wich i am not going to spoil here, was very interesting, the final boss itself was pretty much dogshit. I had enough equipment for 3 army divison, all i needed to use was one pistol... :/ Overall still a more than great game. Would heavily reccomend.",

I've also encountered a bunch of issues where the controls just randomly stop working properly or UI elements never transition out leaving it impossible to interact with anything. Overall this game is just a mess, stick to Mount and Blade I and II, Battle Brothers or even Kenshi if you actually want to have some amount of fun.",

(And I'll say I recommend this game, it's a blast)\n\nI'll focus on the small market because holy moly this hit really close to home.\n\nFew of the misses: Small town late night show wouldn't have a 2 person crew, it'd be the DJ only to save $$$. Also, knowing \"about 35 listeners\" would be pretty rare, didn't seem like they had competition so odds are they wouldn't be paying for the analytics with no local competition... but this is nitpicking no big deals.\n\nWondering where a few folks got their phones to call in, especially in the Maize Maze.  \n\nI've had businesses just like Ponty... and have taken some of the weirdest phone calls so this was spot on.\n\nI'm happy there wasn't a specific state this was located in, I had Ohio/Illinois/Indiana vibes but those call letters would've started with a W instead of a K. (East v West of Mississippi...weird fun fact for y'all)\n\nThere's a few other bits I'd nitpick but it's a video game, and a fun one at that. Fun story, great horror references. The puzzles are a hoot...also I'm amazed how well a video game actually uses real First Aid information and not the usual flubbing that games do. Lot of love went into this game.\n\nThe fact you can save/lose everybody is fantastic, love that it is not just a hard game over, and thank you save states! \n\nOnly a few timer/quick moments really helps as well, and jumpscares are at a minimum! Love it. \n\nIs my type up of this all over the place? Yes. Should I re-do it? Probably. Am I going to? Nah.\n\nJust pick the game up. It's great.",

Deaths of most characters don't have an affect on much of the game, and there's only two endings which aren't exactly hard to get each and generally feel like a letdown.\n\nFun game, just not sure if it's worth the $25 price tag.",

            "review": "Having played only one play through so far, I have to recommend this game to anyone who loves 80s vibes, serial killers and the ability to hit keys on a soundboard at inappropriate times. Not only is it very immersive as a puzzle game, it hits all the sweet spots of horror without being too much. There's a very intricate mystery to solve, plenty of important choices - with sometimes startling consequences - and a really good chill to go up your spine. At the same time there's a lot of levity in the form of playing tunes, hoarding everything you can pick up at your desk and using a sound board to amuse yourself. \n\nThe dialogue choices, along with the important puzzle choices, dictate tone and results in the game that feel true to their weight. You can be under pressure sometimes but nothing's too hard to solve. Just... make sure to examine your clues thoroughly so you don't end up answering a quiz with only half the data. Speaking from experience. #sorryscott\n\nI'll be playing through at least 2+ more times for achievements, so the replay value is already astonishing. It took me about 6-7 hours for one play through and so that's the one thing I have to say about this game: it isn't short, and you don't feel short changed. It seems to have a lot to go through and is well worth the price!",

I truly loved this game and I cannot wait to replay it (which I will be doing immediately). Thank you guys so much for this absolutely beautiful game.",

In a bizarre turn of events it turns out an old town legend known as \"the whistling man\" has began to kill again 20 years after his disappearance. The first victim is the towns sheriff, so her assistant needs to drive to the closest town for help. Sense all of the members of the police station are gone for the night you need to fill in for 911 and take in calls of desperate victims in need of help.\n\n It feels really fun playing as Forrest who's just trying to adapt to his new job and save callers from the town. All of the puzzles are unique and fun in there own way. I really enjoy the graphics as well, its like if borderlands was a horror franchise. The music to this game is outstanding and by far the best part of the whole game. It really feels like music that was made in the 80's. The dialogue is witty and fun, although a few jokes did fall flat for me. The game is decently scary thorough the whole game. When your not trying to save callers who are desperate for help, your exploring more creepy areas in the old radio station. The game is pretty long (taking me 5.2 hours to beat) and super small at only 2 gigabytes required for the whole game. I would give this game an 8.5/10 and if your looking for an entry to the horror franchise I absolutely 100% recommend this game. But if your a horror veteran looking for something extra spooky that will make you cry yourself to sleep, I would recommend something else. But if your looking to have a great time than this game is an excellent choice.",

If you love the vibe you get from the screenshots or game play you've seen, you're gonna love the game, I guarantee it. This game has an engaging plot with equally engaging mechanics. The concept of being a DJ on a late night show is so novel, and incredibly entertaining. I'm only left wishing there was more! It fits perfectly with the 80's slasher horror genre, this game is truly retro aesthetic heaven. I encountered only one small glitch, my tape player stopped accepting ad tapes, which was quickly remedied by a setting called 'Reset All Objects', seemingly integrated for a scenario just like mine. So to same the game was extremely well optimized and bug free is an understatement. All the tracks you could play were bangers! Just as you'd expect from a game so centered around music. Do your best to avoid spoilers before playing, as the story is a mystery and I often found myself having the most fun trying to piece together the mystery while I collected documents or searched around the station, it really puts you into the game. Lastly, I wholeheartedly recommend playing as much as you can in uninterrupted sessions, so you can immerse yourself the story, and feel like you're actually on the job. With all that said, if you're on the fence, get this game! One of my all-time favorites and my personal winner for horror game of the year so far! Thank you Team 17 for an amazing title!",

Worth on sale. \n\nEdit: I didn't realize this game had gotten such poor feedback. Seems to be trendy to hate on AC games, sure it's quite expensive and similar to previous titles. But it delivers a TON of content with a decent story and introducing many new systems. Playing on the highest difficulty the combat has actually been fairly challenging with many different types of fights and unique enemies. If you liked Odyssey and Origins, chances are you will like this game as well. I am not one to stick up for Ubisoft, but it's a bit silly to see so many people jumping on the hate-bandwagon. ",

While the story-line is a little less fluid than AC Odyssey I found it enriching and the content outpaces any other AC game by at least 20 hours. I have thoroughly enjoyed the game, and the final DLC \"The Last Chapter\" is a great way to complete the game (after doing absolutely everything possible in all other DLCs and Main story-line). I honestly wish there were more DLCs on the way but I know I came to the game quite late. Looking forward to AC Mirage in Oct '23!",

            "review": "This game was interesting at first. The combat was difficult, the tactics of Odyssey don't work the same, and the story was compelling enough. There was a point early on where your actions while roaming seemed to have consequences, so I was hopeful. But as it went on... combat became universally easy. Before midgame, I was already unstoppable. I never needed to eat rations anymore. The puzzles were just \"Find the oil jar and carry it to the breakable wall\" or \"Shoot the breakable part of the wall just under the roof and climb through\" over and over, for supplies I haven't needed ever because they become literally free in bulk for some ungodly reason or silver for settlement decorations. Whoop-de-doo. The fishing takes forever for minimal rewards, Orlog was a decent time-killer, but not very helpful, flyting was actually cool, but ultimately a small part of the game. Even the DLC stuff only seemed to give you cosmetics or weapons and armor that were worse than what you already had.\nBut what I hated was the lack of any actual choices. They'd always present seemingly important decisions, and as soon as you think it through and make a decision, the game would make it painfully obvious that the choice didn't matter. Solve a mystery and identify a traitor? Doesn't matter, Eivor will [spoiler]explain that that's the guy in private and then stand back as he monologues and kills everyone with the wine you literally just said was poisoned[/spoiler]. Who should you bribe to end the war? Doesn't matter, your companion will [spoiler]murder the hostage and start the war back up immediately[/spoiler]. Dialogue option 1, 2, or 3? Doesn't matter, if you choose 1 or 2, Eivor will just say 3 afterwards anyway. There's five supposedly big choices that affect the end of the game Witcher 3-style, but the impact is basically just [spoiler]whether your brother likes you or not post-game[/spoiler]. I got this on sale, but it was way too monotonous and disappointing to play again.",

            "review": "I loved Assassin's Creed games in the past. But this will be the first Assassin's Creed game that I have played and not completely finished. Ubisoft outdid themselves this time and in a bad way. \n\nI am starting to believe that artists and location designers are the only people left at Ubisoft that still actually know how to do their stuff. Everything else feels raw, unfinished, boring or downright bad. I'll try to summarize the key points, starting with the things that are sort of done well:\n\n1) Locations. AC has always been a visual \"image of an era\" and Valhalla is no exception. Nordic winter vistas, fjords, nithing cursed sites, decaying Roman ruins with straw huts around them, druid forests, frankish villages - they are all visually interesting to look at and take screenshots of. And this is probably the only thing that I really have no issues with.\n\n2) Music. It's nice, with some quite memorable tracks, like Hrafnsmál - The Words Of The Raven. And it's an immense pain that in actual game the music has been MURDERED with compression. And actually that goes to the sound quality overall - everything is super quiet and compressed it makes you wonder what those 150GB that the game takes are actually for if they can't fit 30-40 songs in good quality in there.\n\n3) Graphics. LOD quality leaves a lot to be desired and textures are weirdly inconsistent. For example, you can have a super detailed Eivor face right next to the 2005 texture quality level shirt that looks like it barely has normalmaps. Snow and snowy dirt barely have proper detail on them as well, especially in Norway. This makes for a very jarring experience when you can't stop noticing the badly done stuff. Again, what are 150GB of game size for if good textures aren't part of it, apparently?\n\nTAA in Valhalla is absolutely atrocious, it murders every bit of detail unless you play at 4K or such. I had played at max settings at 1440p and my game was a blurry mess at native resolution. Valhalla can look decent... nice, even - especially in some cities or unique locations, BUT - you have to jump through some hoops to get it to look better. I had to force my resolution scale to 180% and enforce Nvidia Sharpening and Texture pop filters (5 and 10% respectively) to make it look better.\n\n4) Story. It's alright, but feels a lot like an afterthought for an already selected location for the game. I can't shake this feeling even in DLCs and their respective stories. None of the characters are memorable, they flash through your eyes in a caleidoscope of territory pledge quests, about an hour screen time each maybe. When Ubisoft tries to do emotional moments in story, it just doesn't hit because you can't care less for them. If you wanted to roleplay tough viking that actually paints English shores red with blood, to reave and plunder properly - tough luck, you'll still get punished for killing monks and \"civilians\". And of course main and side stories are spoiled with quota NPCs like black vikings, gay Lunden reeves and so on and so forth. Beating a dead horse at this point but I had to mention it.\n\n5) General gameplay, combat and gear/loot system. Everything I had loathed in Origins and Odyssey is even worse here. Don't believe anyone who told you this game is going to be shorter - it's far from that. At the time of writing this review I am 178 hours in and I still have Ireland, Asgard and multiple roguelite modes left to finish. Activities are littered across the map like cat poop. Every treasure chest, every stone cairn and fly agaric mushroom is now a simple puzzle, but they are repeated so many times it becomes annoying to an extreme. Parkour or physics based puzzles are especially frustrating because they are very clunky and buggy and controls have even worse responsiveness than Odyssey.\n\nI expected at least decent quests and I am super disappointed. Outside of two dozen main-ish questlines, there are only \"world events\" that are super short, super simple and are often downright nonsensical and/or cringe. Yes, I am talking about a lady farting from consuming viper eggs in Ledecestre, for example. This is horrible and Ubisoft should be ashamed of even putting it in, it's not even a comedic relief.\n\nCombat is a step up from Odyssey, in my opinion, but again, very buggy and woven with white threads - you will find your limbs and weapons awkwardly teleporting to your enemies more often than you'd like to see, which is pretty bad for a combat system that is trying to be flashy. Finisher animations are very few so you'll be forced to see the only one available per weapon again and again and again... and again. \n\nThe game is also laughably easy on normal difficulty and frustratingly bad with HP bar sponge enemies at anything higher than normal. Abilities are literally useless and act as \"press X to do slightly more damage\". The only actually useful active ability is an explosive arrow to destroy weak walls and save yourself some time from searching for an oil jar.\n\nGear and builds - all collectable weapons are unique now, so no loot nightmare from Odyssey but that barely matters because of what I wrote above. You'll either smite everything away by simply looking at it at a normal difficulty or will waste 5 minutes per enemy chipping at him without any enjoyment. \n\n6) Technical state of the game. It crashes. A lot. No, A LOT. Usually it happens because the game calls some unexisting function in Ubisoft Connect launcher, can't find it and closes itself completely. Your mileage may vary, but Valhalla is super crashy, be warned. \n\nAll that is spiced up with a traditional for Ubi at this point microtransaction store in a singleplayer game, XP and silver boosters and literal heaps of armor softlocked behind premium currency instead of being available as quest rewards or something. Plus the news about the new AC Mirage flying past Steam again reinforce me in my thought that supporting them was a bad decision and I should refrain from buying their products - it's indeed a product because I can't call it a game nor can I recommend anyone to waste time on it. \n\nUbisoft is incapable to learn and improve, it seems. Don't buy this game.",

            "review": "[code]Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag’s unique focus on naval combat really sets it apart from previous entries in the franchise. However, a lot of technical problems really ruin what would otherwise be quite an enjoyable pirate experience[/code]\n\nAfter naval combat was introduced in [i]Assassin’s Creed III[/i] (the best part of the entire game for many), Ubisoft made the right decision for once and doubled down on the entire thing in the sequel: [i]Black Flag[/i]. With the appropriate setting, pirates in the Caribbean of course, [i]Black Flag[/i] had a lot of potential to be a great game even for those who are not a fan of the typical [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] formula.\n\nAnd even though I played through all mainline [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] up until that point, I actually found the first few hours of [i]Black Flag[/i] surprisingly refreshing. In the beginning, it’s really fun to sail the Caribbean Sea with your own pirate ship, discovering new locations and engaging with other enemy ships in combat to steal their cargo. You then turn your cargo into ship upgrades, which allow you to take on even bigger challenges (read: bigger ships) for bigger rewards.\n\nDuring these times, [i]Black Flag[/i] feels less like an [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] games and more like an entertaining-albeit-simple pirate spectacle. Naval combat isn’t very complex, and your ship upgrades will play a bigger part in surviving a battle than your reaction skills at the end, but it’s simple fun the first few times and a great visual spectacle. This goes especially for ship battles fought during heavy tropical storms, with big waves, heavy rain and a lot of thunder & lightning making for incredible memorable battle experiences.\n\nHowever, as the game goes on and especially during story missions, the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] elements become more prevalent. You’ll spend more time on land than on water, visiting locations that unfortunately all look pretty similar to each other - even those not part of the Caribbean Sea. Once you’re on land, you also got the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i]-mix of assassinating certain targets, tailing people, collecting various side stuff and climbing towers to unveil the map. Little has changed here, making it a typical case of “you’ll like it if you liked it before and you’ll dislike it if you disliked it before”.\n\nIn fact, even though naval combat plays such a big role in [i]Black Flag[/i], at the end, I was surprised just how many of the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] strengths & weaknesses make a return: There’s a huge amount of content – but much of it feels like busy work or copy-pasted. Gameplay systems are easy to understand & use – but they lack depth & variety and thus get tiresome in the long run. And while the main story does have its moments, many characters remain underdeveloped, and the pacing is off. I do have to admit that I liked the Abstergo-elements of the story this time around, even if the ending was unsatisfyingly abrupt.\n\nIn the end, what was a fun pirate game in the beginning turned more into a usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] game along the way. We even got ship tailing missions, which is just going too far. But while the usual [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] mix might have its fair share of problems, it’s undeniable that it also has its charm and there’s nothing quite like it even to this day.\n\nThat said, I will have to spend the rest of the review detailing the numerous (!) technical problems I encountered while playing [i]Black Flag[/i]. These are also the main reason why I’m giving [i]Black Flag[/i] a negative review, as they’re heavily diminishing what would otherwise be an enjoyable pirate [i]Assassin’s Creed[/i] experience. I have no idea if these problems are restricted to the Steam/PC version of the game, but if you want to play the game, you might be better off doing so on console.\n\nThe first issues I encountered concern the graphical settings of the game. For some reason, [i]Black Flag[/i] simply refused to offer a 1440p 60hz option for my main monitor. It did offer all other resolutions at 60hz, but not 1440p for some reason. If I changed this via the settings .ini file, the game simply ignored those changes. If I tried using other monitors, the 1440p 60hz option suddenly reappeared. It’s quite an odd problem I wasn’t able to solve (had to use a different resolution) and have never experienced with any other game before (even Cyberpunk 2077).\n\nThe next issue concerns game content. I originally bought the game back in 2019, first the standard edition and then the season pass afterwards. However, when I started [i]Black Flag[/i] for the first time just a few days ago and activated my key, I found out that I wasn’t able to access my season pass content. Everything I paid for didn’t show up, instead I just received ads for buying said content, adding insult to injury. I’ve spent the past few days contacting Ubisoft support about the issue, but so far, it has yet to be solved as well.\n\nThen came what’s probably the biggest gripe I have concerning [i]Black Flag[/i] – after about 15h of playtime, I opened up the game only to find out that my save was suddenly corrupted. Even Ubisoft Connect with its cloud saves couldn’t help me out (it simply replaced my functioning save with the corrupt one). I have no idea what could’ve caused this, as the game never crashed on me or was forcefully exited, neither was the save data tempered with. I started the game normally only to discover I lost 15h (!) of playtime, with no way to get it back. Everything I did was gone. I highly recommend manually backing up your saves (Steam Cloud doesn’t work for this game), if you still fancy a playthrough of [i]Black Flag[/i] on Steam.\n\nLastly, there were some game breaking bugs I encountered while playing [i]Black Flag[/i]. I’m not talking about minor bugs like this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb77v45Soqc]classic[/url] (which I also experienced) but actual gamebreakers that require a reload if you want to finish a mission. For example, one time my player character spawned inside (!) my pirate ship, with no way to experience the wooden prison. This would be somewhat entertaining if the checkpoints in [i]Black Flag[/i] weren’t so bad sometimes – especially during tailing missions you might lose quite a lot of time. \n\nMaybe I just had bad luck with all of these technical problems happening at once (not counting the many minor bugs like glitching NPCs, etc.) but especially losing a 15h save really turned my playthrough of [i]Black Flag[/i] into an experience I can’t really recommend – even if the underlying game would be recommendation-worthy otherwise. Considering [i]Black Flag[/i] is also available on modern consoles, these might be safer picks if you want to avoid some of these technical problems.",

            "review": "Dear Techland\n\nOK, this is coming from a Dying Light series veteran.\nFInally got a gaming rig and steam 2ish years ago, so all my old DL1 stuff is on my PS4.\n\nDL2 is overall a phenomenal game, hands down the best parkour EVER. (and yes I have played Mirror's Edge 1 and 2) The amount of control and diff parkour moves that are in this to figure out as you play is unmatched.\n\nThis is ultimately what i look for in gaming.  Just give me one massive openworld to explore and freerun around as i please.  Give me a very deep and adjustable skilltree, perks and abilities to upgrade to keep the dopamine hits coming.  I want awesome gearsets, skins, outfits, TRANSMOG!! (thank u finally) and legend levels to keep the end game going for the long haulers.  Most of these things have been provided, but definitely not all.  We'll get into that.\n\nOH, you guys need to make a Gear-set Tab under the Equipped Gear in the Inventory Page.\nWould be nice to be able to switch from my Medic build to my Archer build with 1 click.  \nSame for Weapons.  If i switch to my Archer build, then i would also like to be able to swap my current weapon Load-out for bow, crossbow, guns, etc. (in one click)\n\nAND HOLY $h!t!  let me put the stamina bar directly below the health bar.  i want it on the screen just not right in my damn face.  \nOK...that's out\n\nAs dead as the streets are meant to be.  the public space rooftops need to be frickin' poppin'.\nNamely the city square itself...The Fish-Eye.  I want to see other NPC Night-runners and or Couriers gliding onto that damn rooftop on their para-gliders, and walk into the bar or just anywhere on the roof (mix it up) and even let me walk up to them and they can give me side quests or something, like info on a rare blueprint, again (mix it up).  Imagine seeing other NPCs gliding around the city, going about their business.  Maybe interacting with some.\n(Talk about giving the city a pulse.) \n\nBTW, what happened with having all sorts of different guilds around the map.  Having them hand out missions and whatnot.  this needs to be looked into.\n\nAt night, the people should be locked up in their homes or safe zones...like terrified...like insanely terrified.  However, once that sun comes up, the people should immediately become calm again, opening the windows, doors, etc. (on the rooftops obviously) putting laundry on the clothes lines, baking bread, kids playing, people chatting in their corners, guys chopping firewood, give it a pulse, ya know.\n\nBasically, the Survivors have accepted life on the roofs and that the undead rule the streets below.  Lets embrace that more.  I want to see NPCs freerunning around town on the rooftops.  Parkour is no longer an activity of fitness and expression.  It is the evolution of how we as humans must survive in that world.  Not saying every Survivor member should be a master tracer, but i should be seeing other NPCs out there freerunning.\n\nIt should LITERALLY feel like a night and day difference.  Not just the actual light and darkness.  The people need to reflect this better, the pulse and tone of the city needs to reflect this far better.  Day must be lively and bustling with people carrying on however they would in the \"Modern Dark Ages\".  Night...night should be absolutely terrifying.  I should be hearing NPC mothers telling their children to \"hush\" and \"stay away from the windows!\" from inside their homes on the rooftops, while I'm running around outside.  I should be hearing the utter horror in their voices as they say \"daddy will be back soon kids, don't worry\"  You guys do keep improving the game.  I just reaaalllllly need these things I've mentioned to be added.  I love this game, well the DL Series in general and i want to keep having fun with it.\n\nI'll close with this...may write again\nI know I've found a good game when i can beat the entire game, finish every Main Mission, Side Quest, Bounty Hunt, Random Encounter, World Event, ALL OF IT!\nand yet, I can still find a game within a game.  When i can run around an awesome openworld with nothing holding me back, having everything the game has to offer...i can make my OWN quests, my OWN adventures.  I find myself getting lost in making my OWN fun.  not waiting for devs to give me the next list of check-boxes to check-off.  (not that you shouldn't be giving us content) I just know that i have found a good game, when i can make my own in the meantime. \n \nPlease don't give up on this game.\nThere is definitely something special here.\n\nquik recap_ i know forgot to mention a few of these but check'em out anyway.\n\n1. Gear-Set Tab / Weapon Load-out Tab\n\n2. Guild Factions - give side quests, hidden Blueprint locations, rare gear/weps, outfits, skins, etc\n\n3. Blacksmiths need to have a Workbench...for disassembling, crafting, upgrading, modding, re-rolling, etc.  (side note, let us disassemble gear, not just weps.)\n\n4. Re-Modding / Re-Rolling Gear/Wep Specs - Mods should be able to be swapped WHENEVER ON WHATEVER (at workbenches only, of course) and mods should stack.  \ne.g.  2 Slit Mods should double the crit chance for bleed. (It allows for more options in modding)  and let us re-roll stats on our gear and weps.\n\n5. Pulse or Survival Sense - OK, this one can be controversial, but...You shouldn't start out with this ability, right away AND it should have to be leveled-up.  like lv.1 would be pulse common loot only.  lv.2 could be pulse common loot and rare items.  lv.3 pulses loot, rarities and walkers, lv.4 pulses all enemies.  I mean...however, just shouldn't start the damn game off, being able to pulse everything in the game right off the bat.  Absolute suspense killer.\n\n6. Base Building - doesn't have to be Sons of the Forest or Rust, just have scattered places that we can fix-up/upgrade to add bed, stash, FT>>>, personal workbench, etc.  like the secret Korek Charm Dev Room.  \nLet us fix-up a flat or pad.  have like 2 or 3 per district or something. \n\n7. FULL HUD CUSTOMIZATION - Guys, no HUD...MEANS NO HUD...not the Chase sequence level 1-4, not the Enemy Awareness Meters that circle the damn screen when they're about to see me, no HUD...NO HUD MEANS NO HUD...Immersion guys, immersion.\nI don't need or want it, let the player choose how they want to experience their play-through.\nEvery single individual HUD option should be able to be FULLY customized.\n\n8. FULL CONTROLLER CUSTOMIZATION...FULL...EVERY BUTTON...EVEN CIRCUMSTANTIAL (assassins creed can do it, so can you)  The M&K / Controller is the medium between us and fantasy world you're providing. It's important that feels perfect for the player.",

            "review": "Why the hell is the tutorial over an hour long? I really don't think you need an hour long tutorial for a game released in 2022. \n\nThe gameplay is alright but gets dull after a couple of hours. There is no real danger at all, it takes a year for the chase level to increase for volatiles to chase you and you could just stick to rooftops the whole time and you'll never die. Even if you get swarmed, as long as your have the regeneration booster and some other ones, you could literally face tank everything and kill everything.\nI feel like the gear system needs more work, the stats seem so minuscule that it doesn't make a difference. The only thing that does make a difference is your weapon. \nThe skill tree also needs work, it doesn't seem to have enough impact nor really influence how you play. Especially when you get to the end of the health skill tree, it's an attack skill that you have to attack from above on an unaware enemy which doesn't happen often.\nThey have all of these places of interest like the recent Assassin's Creed games and it's just incredibly annoying with all the markers and it takes the fun out of randomly exploring.\nThe looting system is a huge pain, why do I need to hold down a button to loot every zombie but when they despawn, I can just press it once instead to loot the bag?\nThe enemies are not challenging at all, there is almost no variety between the zombies, humans, or bosses. \nI can make grenades and bombs but ammo and guns aren't a thing in this world?\n\n\nThe parkour is alright but also gets a bit dull after a while. Throughout the story, they give you these puzzles where you basically just look for yellow marks to climb. There are several story missions which you just have to spend several minutes climbing something and it's super annoying. There are also windmills which you have to climb to activate them as well as climbing around in underground metro stations for fast travel points. There are puzzles where you have to connect power sources with a power cable and basically you just look around and connect them, not challenging at all, just tedious and boring.\nLater on, they have a bigger map and introduce paragliders, grappling hook, and fast travel which makes parkour obsolete. I just end up paragliding everywhere.\n\nThe story is just garbage. The ending is terrible. Your choices don't mean too much in the end, the world isn't impacted in a huge way. Thank god you can skip lines of dialogue for the cutscenes, you can just start speed reading everything. I seriously don't like any of the characters at all, even Aiden is a boring MC. \nI have played some of the side quests but most of them are also boring. There was a quest where you had to do a time trial of parkouring THREE TIMES. \n\nThe co-op is fine and I like how they allow a player to TP all the players to an event however, no progression transfers over so if you want to play alone and you weren't the host, you have to redo everything.\n\n",

Still like the original and dlc more tho, esp its zombie vs human ratio, DL2 focus's abit too much on the human side in some parts for my liking for a Zombie game.\n\nTalking of flaws, choose to let x \"live\" and y die because y was so damn obnoxious to the point I had to skip y's dialog in many many places. I would have wanted to choose to let y live because it was logical but the way y's personality was written ugh i'd be tempted to save a hamster's life over y's life.",

            "review": "Dying Light 2 is great but very floaty and inconsistent in how it portrays decline of civilization. If youre looking for dying light one in a new engine youd be close to getting it but my grievances are\n-floaty\n-grapple isnt the same as from dl1\n-no weapon repair\n-easier nights \n-majority of quests are fetch quests with lack of insentive other than reward\n\ndespite all of this i still recommend this as after going back to dl1. I miss the buggy and grappling hook and the lack of guns and other mechanics makes it feel like a downgrade however i can still see the remnants of the former game shine through in the dlc where it pays homage (albeit kinda lazy and cheesy). If you like any of \n-zombie survival with mainly physical weapons\n-parkour\n-a good selection of weapon mods \n-crafting weapons (similar to dl1 but not as great)\n-hang glider (which imo is really great)\n-dark zones where you can find higher level zombies during the day but at night its easier as the high level zombies roam the streets\n-Chases now make the zombies feel like a controlled faction who can work together\n-Choices that kind of matter to story progression \nand more i cannot think of in my sleep addled state. some of these positives may seem negative and they are since dying light 2 is not the game that dl1 was but as its own game its a parkour focused zombie survival game that has a handful of unique npcs that make you wish to meet them outside the safe zone and kill them to take their stuff but that wouldnt matter since some enemy weapons do not drop and the spear can only be thrown by you but enemies can use it as a weapon. Rant over. Game fine but not the best it can be. 7/10 if dl1 was a 10/10",

            "review": "TL;DR The story was mid, the endings are mid, Aiden as a character sucks, the quests have no likeable characters, the parkour did not feel that great, night time was basically day, combat was decent.\n\nPlay Dying Light 1 instead.\n\nDying Light 1's motto was \"Good Night, Good Luck\", which sets the expectation that night time will be dangerous and stayed relevant for basically the whole game.\n\nDying Light 2's motto \"Stay Human\" becomes irrelevant outside of the first few hours and any story points after that was not impactful. The mechanic of managing your time in dark areas becomes useless after the first subway mission since you get flooded with uv/time restoring items, and even when the bar 0s out you only take damage over time before completely turning (death). After that mission I never had to pay attention to it again.\n\nIn my opinion, the only real good point about this game was the combat. The way weapons and blueprints are upgraded/modded, having i-frames while dodging, and the overall hack-and-slash experience was decent. Too bad drop kicking anything other than volatiles and goons is basically meta as it one shots, while max-modded weapons inconsistently do so. Also, the devs are periodically pushing out events that gives players things to do after beating the story so the game is very much still alive.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is the weakest part of this game and is what makes me not want to replay this game in either New Game+ or a new save. Your actions that shape the world do not matter outside of 2 or 3 important story decisions leading to character conflicts/deaths, but the city itself barely changes. In a Dying 2 Know interview uploaded by IGN, Aiden was described as a rich, deep character, but none of that is reflected in the story. \n\nAiden is a glorified errand boy who replies to every request with a \"ugh fine I'll do it\" and is pushed around the whole time. Every transition from a cutscene or dialogue into a fight is through Aiden getting punched in the face every single time. Pilgrims are supposed to be people who go through hardships and danger every day in the wilderness and we later learn Aiden is supposed to be stronger than others, yet all we see is him being a pushover at every encounter.\nThere is also a situation later where a companion is injured, but both Aiden and them, 2 seasoned survivors, somehow do not have any bandages/medical supplies and do not think to get some from a warehouse full of it basically next door. A lame plot device to have Aiden continue the mission solo.\n\nThe \"twist\" at the end of the story also feels forced with barely any build up to it and basically gaslights the player's entire experience up until now, followed by an extremely lackluster final boss. Instead of Aiden being sucker punched to transition into the fight, we the player do.\n\nThe final boss has something like 3 attacks, 2 of which are easily dodgeable AOEs and basic melee swings. They also run away at set situations to force some parkour gameplay, but in my playthrough I shot them with a pk crossbow after they jumped and they teleported back to the first area stuck in T-pose for a minute while I sandbagged. I had to use melee on my range build so that I didn't accidentally cheese the boss fight.\n\nAfter the final mission, it reverts back to before that ever happens and you don't get to feel the consequences of your actions. You also don't have the option to do the mission again and can only continue playing sandbox or do new game +.\n\nAccording to the roadmap, the June 2023 update supposedly addresses issues of the parkour feeling janky and enhances the night, but below are my experiences those before the update.\n\nThe parkour was floaty and I felt like I constantly had issues with snapping ledge grabs, even with ledge grab assist off. If you didn't play with that off, trying to climb down any hole or ledge is a nightmare with Aiden constantly re-grabbing the ledge when you drop or jump. It also snaps onto ledges when you don't want it to, and doesn't snap sometimes when you want it to such as climbing up a lipped edge.\n\nIn the early game, trying jump up a ledge at max jump height (with the hold spacebar for higher jump perk), it was inconsistent whether you would actually grab the ledge or not. I've had to do the same jump 3-4 times before Aiden would actually grab onto the ledge. There are Agility perks you can get later that resolve this issue, but the original issue was not due to Aiden being inexperienced or weakened like Dying Light 1's early game parkour, but simply things not working when they should.\n\nEven later on when you do unlock every agility perk, there are issues with some activating when you don't want it to such as jumping from pole to pole (atop the hospital), but the character wall runs instead of grabbing onto the pole. Some input based actions like Slide also don't work half the time - could be user error though.\n\nDoing things at night felt no different than the day. Every night was a full moon and flashlights had infinite battery, so it ended up being a darker \"day\". You also don't see co-op partner flashlights, which was a strange change.\n\nVolatiles were extremely rare, only appearing when you go into dark zones during the day or by causing a level 4 chase which you have to intentionally trigger. If you do run into any, they are usually alone and camped around a flare so you are never in danger of being ambushed by one, and even if you do they are pretty weak. Unless you get swarmed, it was never difficult to get around during the night. Aside from 2-3 fast infected spawning from holes occasionally while you travel and the streets being flooded with slow infected and howlers, nothing really changed.\n\nAlso, why do we even have to mash a button every time we want to open small containers like baskets and low tier chests?",

I do somewhat agree I was really confused with it's approach and how it delivered a lot of the characters, choices, and outcomes. but I think when compared to the first dying light it isn't as bad as people say it is. I think the story is supposed to put you in this whole situation knowing nothing in a zombie disaster. Years after the whole thing happened you step into it knowing absolutely nothing. I think that's what the developers wanted for the player anyways. Later in the story I began to sort of look at the whole game differently. Dying light 2 almost feels like it's supposed to be some society put into medieval times. A place named villedor with survivors wearing chainmail, cloth sewn together, and leather vests wielding weapons. It's definitely different from the first game where it's based during the beginning of the outbreak when you play as kyle knowing everything while in this game aiden you know nothing only your goal. definitely am going to have to give it a second playthrough to try and understand more. But the gameplay and the combat is the most satisfying and fun I've had in a while. parkour is very nice too and an improvement. I hope this game gets more flavor as the time goes.",

You just sort of shuffle along as your 'run' but when you make a jump, while leisurely shuffling along, you make 25 foot jumps with room to spare.  \n\nThen there are the plot devices and other mechanics de-tuning.  \nWhen you swing your baseball bat at your foes, it swings in slow motion, almost as if it's deciding on whether or not it will hit the target.  \nThen there are the totally predictable plot devices.like the abundance of infected overruns almost from the very beginning of the game. Like where the companion NPC is fiddling with picking a lock of a door all the while the infected are trying to overrun the location.  \nThen there's the broken elevator gag, where the NPC jumps down while warning you about how unstable the elevator is.  But of course he gets off with no problem.  You however, are not so lucky.  you jump down and instead of immediately getting off the 'unstable' elevator, you stand there and wait the full 10-15 seconds till it very predictable falls, taking you with it.\n\nAnd it was after that second very cliche'd and overused plot situation, that I decided I had had enough, and opted for s refund.\n\nSo don't waste your rime if you like likd the first one.\n",

            "review": "TLDR down below.\n\nBest shooter roguelike out there.\n\nHas everything a modern roguelike should have: \n\n- Multiple characters that feel unique:\n Every character has multiple styles of play. You can focus on one of their 2 special abilities or on abilities that improve your weapons. But this is not required, you can use a bit of all 3 styles and still feel strong. Most characters gravitate to certain kinds of weapons with which they will probably do best. All characters have 3 trees of 6 power ups that you can pick from after you finish a stage.\n\n- a lot of different weapons to get:\nThere are over 50 weapons divided into 8 classes. Most weapons feel unique and have their own gimmick. You can carry up to 2 weapons making certain combo's is possible. A downside with such a big selection is of course that some weapons feel like weaker versions of others. Also each weapon being pretty unique means that some will not be suited to your style at all. \n\n- Permanent upgrades:\nThere is permanent progression between runs you can upgrade with a currency you get by playing. I know this goes against the definition of roguelike but all modern rogues have this feature. The devs can make harder/more fun encounters that feel unfair but get less unfair the more you invest in this system which ultimately makes the game better since they can push the boundaries the game. You can also go for an extra challenge by not/ partially investing in this to make it harder for yourself.\n\n- Difficulty settings:\n\nThere are 4 difficulties to play in. You are locked to normal at the start but unlock higher difficulties by beating the hardest difficulty you currently have. The 4th difficulty is the most unique, it features unique upgrades you can buy with the same currency used for the permanent upgrades (this means that currency is not useless when you unlocked the whole prema upgrades tree which is nice) which will change the way you play in a major way and is so much fun! The game never feels to unfair, you can win the game with any combination of weapons/power ups as long as you can keep dodging!\n\n- Many upgrades\nDuring the run you encounter these power ups called occult scrolls, they can straight up boost your damage/survivability or change the way you play. Some boost you in a big way but will also restrict you in a way, there is a lot of different 'builds' you can aim to go for.\n\n- 4 worlds to go through, with their own enemies to fight.\nThe enemies are cool, there is ranged and melee enemies. Some have unique mechanics that are not super hard to play around. Of course this gets harder when it's accompanied by other enemies. Enemies get harder in the later worlds, it's not uncommon to almost get oneshot there. The bosses of these areas are also very good. Huge monsters in their own arena with alot of different attacks that have to be dealt with, and somewhere in between you are supposed to actually kill them.\n\n- Active devs\nThe game still gets regular patches and updates, there is still a roadmap for their future content like in the beta. They have added new characters, bosses, a new world and a new game mode since beta. There is still more to come as well. When you encounter bugs in game there is a feedback option which you can access during your run and explain the bug. And you actually get listened to, every bug I have reported over the years has been fixed in a reasonable time frame, almost always in the next patch.\n\n- Good pricing\nThis game is 100% worth getting at full price. It is more then reasonable if you see the huge amount of content here that puts AAA games to shame. There has been 1 DLC so far which included 2 characters. So far it is the only content that is gated behind a DLC, their new game mode that could have been a DLC in itself was added completely free. If you are looking for a game like this I would just buy it now!\n\n- Multiplayer\nThe game supports multiplayer, there is a matchmaker to play with random people as well. I cannot comment on the quality of that since I never did that. I have only played multi with 1 friend and it was fun, every player gets their own weapon and scroll drops so nobody can 'steal' your upgrades like in Risk of Rain 2. If you don't need your drops you can press a button to make them visible for your allies so they can pick it up. You can help each other get to their preffered build faster but you can't get 'griefed' by people that steal your drops. I feel this is the best way to create a multiplayer experience in a co-op game. The new game mode can also be played with friends. \n\nTLDR:\nif you like this genre, you should definitely buy this. Big worlds, al lot of characters, weapons and power ups. Different difficulties for everyone, a multiplayer that is done extremely well for a co-op game. The devs should feel very proud of what they accomplished with this game. I look forward to the bright future of this game!\n\nThe game has this big \"one more run\" feel that every good roguelike should have.\n\nIf I have to put a number on it it's a 9,5/10 for me. I hope this review helped any people with doubts to make a good decision!",

            "review": "Meh, I want to like this game more but it's got a lot of problems for me personally. It's not bad, I enjoy it and play it with friends or on my own occasionally but everytime I do nowadays I just end up irked over one thing or another. I could probably recommend it if you like this sort of thing, but I'd like to list out my problems as someone that's played both a lot of shooters and roguelikes/lites.\n\nAlthough I'll start with the good, the gunplay and weapon designs are incredible and a ton of fun to mess with, reincarnation is incredible too, the wacky builds you can pull off at that point are a ton of fun. That's really the main positive here, and if that's good enough for you you'll probably love this. It's great for more casual play.\n\nThe problems start with the enemies, its not necessarily their attack patterns, their hp, or anything like that. They're well balanced, but for a few reasons they don't *feel* satisfying to fight. The way they move around is kind of awkward, rigid, and janky, its not smooth at all and feels random and just frustrating enough to lower the feel of combat for me. Its not bullshit or anything, but it makes it harder to enjoy the great gunplay and with enough playtime it became harder and harder for me to overlook.\n\nThe game has a lot of content, side modes and such that might seem like nice mixups at first but it all ends up being kinda mediocre and I just end up playing reincarnation instead. Spirtual Assault is still a complete mess, its not a bullet sponge hell-hole anymore but its just soooo boring and really highlights the unsatisfying enemy design. It needs to seriously be cut down and better paced, it goes on way too long for how mindless and spammy it is. The final boss for it is designed okay move-wise but is still annoyingly tanky and unfun to fight as a result.\n\nThe further you go into the game progression wise the more of a problem the stat system becomes.  It's much better to stick with one weapon early on with good affixes and pump all the money into it. Unless you're playing a character like the dog there's little reason to ever switch between two weapons, ammo is plenty and its way too costly to invest into two weapons when you can just funnel everything into one broken one. \n\nThis isn't inherently a problem necessarily but then it leads to runs becoming samey, you're just waiting until you get an OP combination and then just spamming that weapon at enemies, it leaves the combat loop lacking depth, the only skill thats really rewarded as a result is the ability to dodge enemies. There's no major tactics here, most characters except like, the monkey, have a clearly defined weapon type/s they're good with, so thats what you go for. \n\nYou want shotguns/melee, you play the bird, you want smgs/assault rfiles play the bunny, fire weapons? the fox. I wish the characters were more open-ended in their design, would be much more interesting for builds.\n\nOverall its not a bad game, just a shallow one. Don't go into this one expecting any major complexity or depth. You shoot the bad guys, dodge occasionally, and build around whatever rng has given you. It's a passable way to spend the time, but there's both roguelites and shooters out there that offer way more depth and engaging gameplay than this if thats what you're looking for.",

            "review": "Gunfire Reborn is easily the most polished, feature-rich, and addictive roguelite FPS on the market. The roguelike/roguelite genre as a whole has had a slow journey into the FPS genre-hybrid, and among all of its competitors I would consider Gunfire Reborn to be essentially peerless at the moment. Don't let the whimsical, cartoonish artstyle put you off of an amazingly gratifying instanced looter-shooter experience-- even back in early access this game managed to squeeze roughly 50 hours of playtime out of me, and now that the game is in its finished 1.0 state and is being updated with small character/weapon DLCs, its calling me back for EVEN MORE runs.\n\nThe core gameplay in this game is PHENOMENAL. Well paced, deeply satisfying, and deceptively complex. Each weapon you happen upon during a run is amazingly unique and intricate-- and beyond that, each weapon drop comes with an additional set of modifiers to add to its unique characteristics. Gunfire Reborn's weapon roster spans a delightful range of forms & figures; including hefty rocket launchers, nimble SMGs, 'Iron Man' style laser gloves, flaming kunai, and much more. The game's arsenal has something for every mood and every playstyle, which is absolutely crucial to the gameplay loop of any roguelite.\nSomething else integral to a roguelite's depth is power-ups, or modifiers. Throughout each of its stages, Gunfire Reborn will present the player with heaps of augments to specialize your build. Building a run based on fire damage? Start boosting your elemental DOT! Relying heavily on grenade spam? Increase your grenade's damage or carrying capacity! Feeling sluggish? Why not invest heavily in movement upgrades? This build diversity helps Gunfire Reborn to succeed not just as a first person shooter, but also as a bonafide roguelite.\nThe level design is fantastic as well in this game! Each zone feels memorable and diverse, as well as being loaded with uniquely challenging enemies. Complete with secret zones, shop/upgrade NPCs, as well as a variety of level bosses, progressing through a run of Gunfire Reborn is a satisfyingly impactful and atmospheric experience, in no small part due to the actual locales it will have you fight your way through.\nSpeaking of fighting: The enemies you will be pitted against during your run are wonderfully imaginative and (for the most part) always a joy to fight. The game's cartoon style, while perhaps off-putting to some, lends itself to some fantastic enemy designs. Possessed terracotta soldiers, teleporting bird snipers, fireball casting lizard sorcerers, umbrella shaped yokai, giant rocket lobsters-- its all here, and waiting to swiftly end your run. Enemies are also occasionally given special shield/armour bars, which are weak to specific elemental damage types, further deepening the combat/character building experience. Fans of the 'Borderlands' franchise should feel right at home with this elemental weakness/resistance system. At the best of times, Gunfire Reborn's enemy variety serves to give it a frantic, almost \"boomer shooter\"-esque quality-- and one I find to be sorely lacking among other roguelite FPS games. \nThe art direction is very colourful and engaging, and paints a picture of a chaotic, vibrant fantasy world. While the animations aren't necessarily in the same league as the work of modern triple A titles, enemy movement, reload animations, boss attacks, etc... are all very fluid and expressive. Gunfire Reborn might not be a gritty, hardcore take on the FPS genre, it isn't trying to be, and benefits on the whole from its stylization.\nSound design in this game is... mostly pretty good. Gunshots feel impactful, minor FX and embellishments are solid, dealing/receiving damage feels responsive, and the character voice lines are... alright. Gunfire Reborn may not have the same immersive soundscapes as something like CoD or Battlefield, but its eccentric sound design works well within its cartoon artstyle.\n\nOverall, Gunfire Reborn is a deeply mechanically satisfying and nicely polished FPS roguelite, and currently stands out as the absolute best of its hybrid genre. (Not that there's a TON of competition at the moment.) The game is still being updated with free content as well as paid DLCs at the time of writing this review, so its only getting more dense with features as time goes on. Gunfire Reborn is absolutely the type of game that will have you glued to your chair at 3am, promising yourself that THIS run will TOTALLY be LAST ONE of the night. (It won't.) I love this game deeply, and if you're a fan of roguelikes/roguelites and/or FPS games, there's a solid chance that YOU will too.",

            "review": "Easily among the best adventure games of all time, despite its few flaws.\n\nAbsolutely great action combat that goes out of its way to really fulfill the immersive fantasy. When you play a big hulking warrior swinging a massive sword, you feel like it. When you play an athletic scoundrel archer you really feel like it. When you play a fragile mage trying to cast difficult, complex and devastating spells, you really get the reward of feeling like it.\n\nThe dramatic gothic-romance of grim fantasy oozes from every pore. From desperately surviving your first encounters with goblins to heroically climbing upon a giant monster to stab it repeatedly while clinging for dear life all the way to the truly most-epic dragon fight in video  game history ... and beyond. I can think of only a few games which manage to give skeletons crawling from dusty ancient tombs the very real chill of horror and fear that they deserve. Alien nightmares erupt around you deep within the forgotten bowels of a mysterious dungeon giving an immediate sense of urgent confusion and the very real knowledge that sometimes the wise course of action is to flee from an overwhelming foe - if you can.\n\nNPCs are a little bit perfunctory in some cases. This is not an RPG. The characters in the world are there to serve a purpose, not to develop a relationship with or to demonstrate their own personality. Some of them are far more interesting and charming than others, of course, but in the end dialogue in this game (although there's plenty enough of it) is not a major focus of development. Ironically, the soulless pawns that travel with you have the most to say about... everything. Their comments are helpful, insightful, informative or even just encouraging and supportive. Sadly, the \"romance\" system is not really for the purpose of romance, it's for the sake of an important plot point later in the game - one which was handled very... abstractly.\n\nThe bad? Well. They're more like complaints, really. The user interface is an archaic and clumsy mess. The game was created with limited controllers in mind, and this makes navigating menus for either inventory management or equipment comparison into a dreadfully tedious chore compounded by how harshly limited your carry capacity is (though this is necessary for gameplay balance reasons). At some point it will feel like you have plenty of options in terms of equipment to compare between, but often it will feel like there just isn't anything you really want to wear (an important consideration since dressing up your pawn is a major motive for exploration, and the camera is over the shoulder so you want to look good for your own sake even from behind). Overall, the itemization is a bit too limited and most equipment just isn't very different from any of the rest (though the few things that do stand out will become your favorites... and you'll never unequip it for the rest of the game...).\n\nThe most serious complaint, however, is that the world is ... a bit sparse. Which makes it feel a lot smaller than it actually is. This is difficult to really explain, though, because for the first forty hours you play, you'll discover some random new dungeon or weird little secret and it'll feel amazing - and it will be amazing. Eventually though, you'll realize that for every new little dungeon you discover, you've passed by three blank alleys in Gran Soren with absolutely nothing in them. You can wander around and constantly ask \"why isn't there anything here?\" for hours and hours and hours while exploring. There's nothing behind the cathedral. It's just a big open space where nothing ever happens. There's no point to the huge empty plateau, you only go there for one minor quest and it takes like ten minutes to run across it. Some games from a similar era of game development like the Elder Scrolls managed to pack way more content into worlds of comparable size. It doesn't need to all be on the \"overland\" map (where the drama of traveling to suddenly have to desperately fend off a bandit ambush is a major part of what makes this a grim low-fantasy epic story). But it'd be nice if Gran Soren were actually a city and not just three merchants with a five minute walk to get to the castle where The Quests are handed out.\n\nEven so, any sequel could surely rake in mountains of cash if it were accomplished with even comparable quality.\n\nThis one still manages to very fairly earn its place among the greats. If you like Skyrim, for example, you absolutely owe it to yourself to play Dragon's Dogma.",

            "review": "A quick overview of the game's post-release evolution. When this game released, it felt very sluggish  - moving, engaging, looting all felt slow. The devs did a massive overhaul of combat, increasing movement speed, combat moves and cooldowns, and there are simple loot filter and auto-pickup options (neither of which need to be enabled. They are off by default). This level of attention after the release of the game, when other devs might have moved on, is remarkable to me. They took a game that was Not Bad and made it into something very memorable to me.\n\nAfter that overhaul, seasons with unique season mechanics began. These have unique mechanics that cause enemies and/or anomalies to appear in normal missions and interacting with these give you progress toward season-specific boss missions. The season will also have a new type of affix that can now appear on weapons (such as one affix that allows you to release lightning on hit or being hit while other affixes combine to make it chain longer or do more damage, etc). There are also the equivalent of runewords (psalm-code doctrines) and the components can be removed at any time and leave both the item and components intact for use in other gear.\n\nThe sound is good, especially the fighting sounds of guns, melee, fire, explosions and more. There's nothing like jump packing into a mob that explodes as you use a las cannon or flamer to melt the survivors. The story is fine though nothing to write home about. Leveling is steady even at higher levels, making the tarot cards that give extra XP feel like viable options.\n\nThere are a couple options for endgame. You can continue regular missions (of which there are 10 types) that you can do to earn gear and reputation in the respective systems (of which there are 20). Acquiring reputation unlocks additional systems and, more importantly, tarot cards. Tarot cards are the difficulty + reward multipliers for any endgame map. A card will specify the type of negative and positive it will give you - I.E. melee enemies get a random damage or defensive buff but you have a chance to double the end-of-mission rewards. Some tarot cards also raise the area level until it is many above your own, allowing the game to continue scaling after level 100.\n\nThere are also random intel missions which are short quest chains with a reward at the end and it provides you 2-3 mission types to choose from at each step.\n\nThe main endgame option is Void Crusades. There are 9 different ones, each with its own static map creating a web that connects the nodes. You can path through the web differently depending on if you want the maximum reward chests at the end or if you want to save the nodes that raise the difficulty of all remaining levels so that you have an easier run overall.\n\nI haven't touched on many things like the solid crafting/rerolling system (you can modify all but one class of item as many times as you want) or character classes (3 base classes with 3 specializations each in Inquisitor, the WH40K:Inquisitor - Prophecy stand-alone game has another campaign and character with it that can also be used in this game, and the Sororitas DLC that came out recently is a 5th class (class only, no new campaign/missions).\n\nI've played this game on and off for years. I never bought into the random negativity in the discussion board. I just get on for a few weeks at a time and have fun purging heretics, xenos, and daemons.",

Leveling up, going through the campaign, playing all of the classes, are all fun to do. I love the Warhammer 40k setting, but the game really falls apart at endgame.\n\nTo put it into perspective, this is the first season I participated in and the first time I fully completed the campaign. After putting in 160 hrs into this season, I still haven't had the one piece of armour with the enchant I need on it to finish my basic build. The make matters worse, it is of a rarity type that you aren't able to reroll the enchant in hopes of getting to one you need. The chances of finding a specific type of armour with the exact enchant you need is astronomical. \n\n  I also have not yet been able to complete the last seasonal goal of upgrading a tarot card to level 3. The reason for this is that if you upgrade your tarot cards when you can, as a player would naturally do, you have just added weeks, months, or even years to your grind without knowing it. The only way you can avoid that is to stumble upon a new player tips guide or forum post somewhere before you make that mistake. It also means that when I unlock a new type of tarot card from gaining reputation in a star system, I'm not happy about it, but get angry because they just instantly added another week to the grind. I ended up adding weeks of extra RNG to my tarot card upgrading before I found out how the system works. \n\nI can say I will not participate in endgame again, as the amount of RNG and grind is unreal. It rivals any mobile game, but in mobile games at least people have the option to pay to speed up their progress and not spend months or years grinding it out. Whoever runs the maths on this stuff is so out of touch with reality.",

            "review": "Eat my nuts Ubisoft, you are so grossly disconnected from your community. It is a true shame to watch a game that you enjoyed and loved be slowly butchered by a company that only exists to slowly drain the wallets of their fan base. I sternly believe that Ubisoft purposefully brings out stupid updates and changes to slowly kill the community so that they can let the game die and move on to other projects, while also doing crossover events to steal the money of their dedicated player base. I think ubisoft is just ashamed to come outright and say that they don't want to support or update the game anymore, and just wish to slowly kill the game along with its community.\n\nUbisoft, long ago, ever since they switched dev teams, have lost sight of what siege was supposed to be. Siege is unique, the original path of the game was to have it be a sort of in-between your average arcade shooter and your slow tactical shooters like Ready or Not. However, over the last several years, I feel as though this concept has been lost on Ubisoft, they even try to vilify the part of the community which disagrees by creating the character Deimos. This brings me to the story, why the hell is there one. The lore of the game was that Rainbow Six was a multi-national counter terrorist agency designed to eliminate the most dangerous of terrorist threats. Great, stellar, that is all we needed. Nighthaven was a decent concept, but it was executed so poorly. I think it would have been great to add a PMC group to the team, seems great, but then you give them ungodly advanced levels of technology, rivaling and even surpassing entire nations, that then for some reason creeps into the lore of certain gadgets. It was so unnecessary to do this, I just don't understand why it was done at all. An actual story was and is being developed, and I can't understand why, they bring in a character named Deimos who they say is the villain, yet his only flaw is his moral compass. He is objectively right about rainbow six as a whole, it being a joke and no longer the intimidating counter terrorist organization it once was. Early on in their development of the story, they transition the leader of Rainbow from some lady to some British guy named Harry. This was the start of the fall for siege, as it signified the start of this random ass story building that they wanted to do. \n\nNow a bad story may not necessarily mean the gameplay is bad... except it fucking blows ass. Ubisoft, in the same way they ruin the story, they bring out certain changes to slowly ruin the game. Sledge is a prime example, he was a good operator, in no way broken, he wasn't even very highly picked, yet they took away his smg 11 and made him a 1 armor, and then to add insult to injury they took away his acog later on. What was the point of this, he was never broken or over picked, he was pretty well balanced, and now he is just a worse pick than buck or ash. While not all balance changes are as bad as this, the vast majority of changes that Ubisoft decides to bring out are just bad for balancing. They also have a tendency to nerf things rather than to buff them, or if they do buff operators, they don't make an impactful change. This leads to all ops becoming worse and therefore not as fun, rather than uplifting other ops and making those more fun. The last set of changes have been things such as the UI or kill indicator. They had no reason to change any of these, especially the ubisoft overlay which barely even works and somehow still buggy despite being years after release. The kill indicator is no longer quite as satisfying and snappy as it once was, which makes kills feel less rewarding and not as fun. Continuing, the UI is just a mess. It is confusing, especially for new players, and was so unnecessary. It also plays more into the concept of this game becoming more arcady and \"cartoony\". Lastly, and likely one of the worst changes so far, is the ranked 2.0 system. For some reason, people fail to understand how it works, so the rundown is basically that there are two mmrs that a player has, a hidden and visible, the hidden is what actually pits players against each other, the the visible just exists as its own thing? Like who verified that this was a working system, why in gods name did they try to be innovative on a system that was tried and tested? The hidden mmr system just doesn't seem to work, pitting what would be ranked 1.0 plats against ranked 1.0 champs. Leading to imbalanced, irritating, or boring games, along with poor balancing. The visible mmr also serves no purpose, as it is criminally easy to hit higher ranks, leading to a more than 1000% increase in the amount of Champions. Why does it exist, why are players not given a ranked based off who they play with, why is it based off how well they play against their specific skill level? It leaves no incentives to improve and only the incentive to play and hit champ. The fact that a person with a 12% win loss can hit champ is disgusting. The best of the best of players are the ones meant to be hitting the highest rank in the game, yet for some unholy reason, they just invite morons into the group. If I remember correctly, take this with a pinch of salt, I believe their justification for this was to \"reward players not just based off skill but also how much they play\". They essentially removed the ranked part of the definition of ranked. If I played chess for 16 hours a day for the rest of my life, but remain among the worst players of the game, why in gods name should I be given the title Grandmaster when I would not be able to compete against any other legit Grandmaster? It makes no sense to reward people for play time, and grant them something that they do not deserve. The incentive to play in ranked 1.0 was to improve so that you could hit the higher rank. Without the need to improve, it leaves the community overall worse. Maybe the devs brought it out so they could finally hit a rank past gold.\n\nNo words, not even an entire essay, could describe my dissatisfaction with Ubisoft and how they have handled this game. They have failed the community, the gameplay, and somehow, the core concept of the game itself. It would take an utter buffoon to see what is happening and think to themselves, \"this is perfectly fine\". Take a lesson from any competitive shooter and stop focusing on your casual community. I think the view point of focusing on it to just be completely wrong. While it may bring temporary life into the game, most casual players don't really care about the game and can leave on a whim. Focusing on the ranked community, particularly those at the top bracket to ensure the longevity of a game as those are the people who tend to be the most passionate about the game. Further, the devs of this game either don't really play the game or suck ass at it, so they aren't even good at understanding balance changes. For a lot of games, the devs are actually pretty good at the game, this is because they built the game so they understand it. I would think the devs for Siege, now being the one's making it, would also understand it. Of course not that would be smart and reasonable.\n\nI will sadly, and much to my own chagrin, keep playing the game. This is because there is no other game around like it, and frankly,  this is the only reason the game is still around. Everyone shits on EA for their crappy economy decisions in their games, yet for a lot of the games, they improve and fix this issue, and even in the case of the sports clones, it is easy to just avoid their copys. Just look at battlefront 2, it is a stellar game now but it did release to some controversy. Yet Ubisoft, rather than trying to improve their game, reward the worse parts of the community, and sacrificing everyone who actually cares about the game. They are as arrogant and foolish as Narcissus, since both Ubisoft and he fell in love with themselves.",

            "review": "Cult of the Lamb is an amazing game. The best part of this game is the art style and cult management system because it helps the player really get sucked into the world and feel like a cult leader. You decided how devious or benevolent you want to be to your followers and other NPC. The base building system is mostly well done, I like the large variety of buildings, but there still could be some more automation in the later game when you have 15-20 followers. I think the soundtrack is good, and a few songs have got stuck in my head. The flaw of Cult of the Lamb is the roguelike gameplay, the enemies and bosses need more attack variety, or maybe I should have played on a harder difficulty for more challenge.\n\nThe most important thing you should know before purchasing is that Cult of the Lamb feels like two thirds base building and cult management and only one third combat. So Stardew Valley players rejoice and Binding of Isaac players might be sad and think Cult of the Lamb is over hyped and has a lack of replayability.",

The Controls are easy and simple, it really is addictive always something to do and it is very good for people who just want a chill time,but quite fun. You do have to repetitive tasks to do, but its a good way to waste a few hours, if your not sure on what to do. it is always quite easy to level up on and get stronger, and you can choose to be evil fully or equally generous leader, I have not come a cross any bugs through the game. you can name them what ever you like, they can even be swear words if you so choose to. a great game to have fun on would recommend anyone to try this. the only thing you can't control is the traits of your followers which is randomly generated by the game but If you don't like the traits you can sacrifice the follower later on by feasting on them, taking them to missions to find resources knowing that they will die if they fail you know normal evil things :). Please try it out for yourself.",

Even though devs introduced some end-game recently in the dungeons but there was no updates in regards to the second part - your cult(even though you can always place more decorations and stuff), and I have to say there's better rogulites IMO if you're just looking to do some runs(Hades still on top tbh)\n\nI can easily recommend this game if you like what you see in the trailer and screenshots - trust me you, won't be dissapointed. \n\nAnd I'm hoping for more to come in terms of the updates. Roadmap looking busy. DLCs are not necessary, only to support the devs(I bought one).",

            "review": "Cult of the Lamb is an amazing diverse game. Half of the game is action adventure with some RPG elements & the other half of the game is base building cult simulator. It's great how you can't play this game one half without the other half and how both are well developed & fun to do. Besides making sure that you become a powerful warrior lamb and keeping your followers fed & away from being sick, there is a ton of fun to be had with certain mini games like fishing or gambling by playing dice. Beware of cool soundtrack, cute visuals and some sinister events during the story mode! It's also amazing to see the developers giving free updates & patches on a regular basis. Anyone who has a Twitch account or enjoys games like Don't Starve or Dante's Inferno, should definitely give this game a try!",

            "review": "LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\n\nCult of the Lamb is a unique game to say the least, the game is about you being a leader of a cult and you gotta kill the other cults too. It has some fun features but still has some downsides. Its still a really great game and heres a few some pros and cons so lets begin:\n\nPROS\n-Progression is quick(WHICH ILL GET ONTO) and hard it depends on how many cult members you have which makes it so collecting cult members has a purpose. There are 3 progression ways, one that affects the cult in general(buildings and stuff) and Sermons which affect the battle aspect like giving for weapons or curses and finally Doctrines which affect the cult members and rituals you can peform, you may think its all to much but in reality is really satisfying to go through.\n\n-Cult of the lamb also has some sort of customization like change your cult members animal or adding patterns and buildings to your base it gives an animal crossing vibe i enjoy. \n\n-The main part of the game is the crusades you can buy stuff from shops save/rescue cult members and is your main source for beating the game. The different environments are all really cool and actuallly FEEL different than each other.\n\n-Bosses are particually well made then follow the same aspect as the orignal enemy, like a scorpion shoots small fire balls while the boss version shoots big fireballs, and the main bosses are all 3 mini bosses mixed which is so cool!(you could say they ran out of ideas but its cool either way)\n\n-The different zones you can discover actually server a purpose, they can upgrade certain aspects like your relics or tarot cards, some NPCs give tailsman shards which can give the play fleeces(ill get on those at the cons)\n\nok now for some cons.\n\nCONS\n-The mos controversial one here, the new free DLC is shit. Yep im gonna admit it. If you havent seen it, its basically RE DOING the entire game again but just harder, and the main guy who you give the god tears too isnt even a boss. hes just... there.. The only good thing i like about this DLC is the inclusion of relics which saved my life a lot of times. other than pretty mid\n\n-Fleeces suck ass. They are the worst thing you can equip. Some of them remove health, remove rolling, and remove proper damage. The only good fleeces are the DEFAULT yes the DEFAULT and the fleeces of fate(gives you 4 tarot cards but you cant get anymore) the rest of them are just bad. I guess the fleece from the one who waits is good but still.\n\n-And a very popular arguement, the progression system IS WAY TOO FAST, if you have like 30 cult members get ready to keep upgrading and upgrading. And building stuff that does absoulutely nothing for the rest if your playthrough. Some buildings or upgrades are COMPLETEY USESLESS(crow trap, morgue II, tabernacles)\nwhy didnt they just make tabernacles II which is actually useful. well idk and it should be improved.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nI know i should be too harsh since this is an indie game. But i would say this has some great potential but just has some holes that could improved. If you like dungeon crawlers, or animal crossing type game, i would recommend this and i would say it worth the price so enjoy!!\n\n7.5/10\n\n(REMINDER: this game is still being in development this means updates and more are planned soon, if you see UPDATE PRO or UPDATED CON this means they are pros and cons from this new update ok bye)",

Due to this, I vowed that when I had kids, I would take an interest in their hobbies, whether they be sports, gaming, or whatever else! And that’s why I became a 45 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am the father to my son, Alfred, who is now 14. Recently, my son downloaded this game and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was devastating for me, as instead of bonding over ping pong, he was locked away in his room. As a result, I decided to make a Steam account, and get this game and take an interest in his hobbies, as my father had never done. I loaded into the game, and had no clue what to do, so I asked my son for help, and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it, as he hadn’t seemed this happy since we went rock climbing together in 2018. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again, and now we spend time together on hobbies that I grew up with, such as fishing. This game reminded me that there’s fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both I and my son many happy memories.\n",

            "review": "This is one of the best open world zombie survival game out on the market. I am a big fan of Walking Dead that's why i was looking for a game which is open world zombie survival and has base building and this is it. The game has a great community with a developer team who cares about feedback. There are dev and community streams. Still getting updates in 2023. Before you think this game can do more stuffs than currently available things i just tell you it could but. The dev team have limited resources because the most of them is already left SoD2 to work on State of Decay 3 with the Gears of War devs. They use this game to get feedback on things to create a better new game (SoD3) with these new features. Unfortunately because of the limit of the engine and the capacity of the team will lower the chances of big changes or updates i just say it to keep this in mind. You can play this game however you want. There are multiple maps, bases and customizable difficulty options. You can build your base however you want there are slots and in that slots you can build different stations. There is a 4 player online coop with limitations but at least we have and there is a chance that this will get a revamp because of a multiplayer survey. I don't wanna tell you more, there is much more to discover just get it and try it out! Definitely worth 30€, but if you can't buy it for that much, then wait for the sale and buy the game.\n\nUndead Labs keep up this great work!",

And affects the pace of the game too much in a negative way.\n- Stop with the radio please.\n- Quest system is poor. And it is a shame that side quests needs to pop up again every time you restart the game. Also, sometimes you lose a quest by changing characters and this is just not a good system.\n- Combat against humans are bad, just bad. This game would be hugely better if exchanging gun fights were better.\n- It is a sandbox, I know, but the way you interact with stories should be overhauled in the next SOD.\n\n[code]These are problems that has been brought by the previous SOC game and I hope they address all this to the next SOD because this franchise has a huge potential.[/code]\n\n[h1]Leaving the rant behind, let’s point out the good stuff:[/h1]\n\n+ SOC2 is unique. It is a mix of sandbox survival and community management in a certain casual triple A experience with in depth systems and mechanics that makes this game something else. Definitely my favourite “Xbox exclusive” so far.\n+ The constant updates and upgrades are a common thing nowadays, even so  it’s impressive how the devs are still adding stuff, upgrading and rebalancing the game.\n+ The DLC Homecoming is an upgrade for those looking for a more story driven experience - without losing the sandbox uniqueness of the game. \n+ Replayability.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe sandbox experience as a main focus is the main selling point for me. No drama and cinematographic bu11sh1t. No save the world bu11sh1t. There is no hero and death is permanent. \n\nCommunity managing is something I would like to see in other open world experiences as well. \n\n[code]Enough of construction simulator on survival games, please, lol. Just follow what SOC2 does, please - and improve upon that, of course.[/code] \n\nIf you have never played give it a try - or have played before but a long time ago, give it another try. The game has its problems but it is a delicious casual experience without losing deepness for those who enjoy a bit more. \n\nLooking forward to SOC 3.",

            "review": "State of Decay 2 while is initially pretty engaging eventually runs into mediocrity thanks to the raw repetition of things  but it'll take you quite awhile to get to that point. State of Decay 2 on the right difficulty will leave you with dramatic scrambles to deal with hordes of zombies or special zombies if you manage things poorly or do not bring the needed supplies to deal with it and absolute success with reasonable planning and patience. It's a really solid zombie open world shooter if you're into that thing.\n\nThe biggest standout feature is the community system, which is new as well as having multiple maps to play on. The character generation is fairly big with different survivors having different sets of skills that they can bring to your base, meaning that they aren't divorced completely from your base like they kinda were in the first SOD. Each base has it's ups and downs, even if it seems like a straight upgrade. Some bigger bases are just frankly utterly terrible for dispatching hordes and juggernauts, they'll flood in and everything turns into a bloodbath. The key is picking the one that has many good spots for survivors to dispatch zombies while having key faculties that help manage your community. The upgrades aren't as essential as they seem, some quests and outposts you can setup in the openworld provide for the spaces in your base development you cannot fill. It's just way way way way better than the original State of Decay, which was a very annoying system to deal with. \n\nAnother big part is the dynamic nature of the game as a sandbox. Survivors are generated randomly, whole other communities are randomly generated too. The game invites you to make your own player driven stories through those interactions often finally peaking with a designated leader and their ultimate goal for the community. This is essentially your endgame. It's a great way of pacing the game out a little and you get bonuses for completing a \"community\" every time you do this. Then you can take survivors from your current playthrough and save them for future playthroughs, so if you like that mechanic guy who you saved from a juggernaut and he learnt to build all your badass cars for you and you want him to come along for another ride? You can totally do that. It's pretty flexible and adds a level of meta progression that grows stronger with you being invested emotionally and gameplay wise. It's generally a pretty fun system.\n\nThe problems with this system is repetition, you will start to see the same sort of events happen over and over around your third playthrough. The community's overall goal and that questline of sorts rarely changes. It always sorta rolls out the same way which doesn't hurt too bad because most of the time your community progression is built towards making the area you are in safer from plague hearts (essentially red zombie disease) first and foremost. Be it through allying yourself with other communities and trading for supplies or them directly assisting with dispatching them. \n\nThe moment to moment gameplay isn't spectacular, especially as other third person shooters go but it's serviceable. There are a looooot of guns. A lot of weapons. There is a lot of loot to collect and find. If you like grabbing everything in a building that isn't nailed down, this might be your game. Zombies are fairly intense to fight as well, they aren't pushovers especially on your own. If you're on a weak character and the difficulty is high, watch your ass because it won't take much to kill you. If a feral shows up and you're low on health? Your character is dead. The game appreciates stealth chiefly of all but it has the drawback of being a slow way to play the game and frankly kinda boring even if it's a really strong way to play. Go in guns blazing, slashing everything. It's a zombie game after alll! \n\nA short piece of coop, it's a really flawed unfun system that i am surprised is this halfbaked. It's not good. I hope to see maybe coop communities (maybe set it up similar to stardew valley?) in a third game out of Undead Labs because the sheer amount that you are locked out of doing as a coop partner is aloooooot. It's really not great. Don't get this as a coop game.\n\nI think there is a lot here in State of Decay 2 to enjoy, not for as long as other games but it's an immensely fun journey if you're the right person for it. The foundation here is a lot stronger than SOD1 and i can see this evolving into something really awesome if they nailed out the game's design issues. Think 7 Days to Die but you're managing a whole group of survivors, your friends included. That would be insanely awesome. Undead Labs has put a lot of effort into the post-release content and understanding what people want from this game. I can't recommend this game if you're obviously lukewarm on the genre or open world games in general but if you are then you're gonna have fun for at least 10-30 hours. That's a good sell for a game pass game.",

Since there's a lot too do. Obviously it is kind of repetitive since well your pretty much always looting, fighting or destroying plague's heart. In the end the game is worth it with the daybreak mod which allow you too buy some member of the red talon team for your community. The worst thing about the game in my opinion is definietly multiplayer. If you join someone else, you basically risk your character's life for nearly no reward... as the host get most of the best (which is kind of normal but instead could just make it so both player get reward. The players that are not the host cannot walk too far away from the host... which is kind of stupid since it makes it annoying when your trying too loot a place or even run away from a horde (or any other type of threat). Basically , the multiplayer mode is kinda nice but could be WAY better in any term of optimization such as making it possible too have equal loot and not being limited in where you are going on the map. It could also be nice too add the option too let a player go trough my base's storage as when someone joins you they need too use their own ressource... adding on the fact they don't get as much ressource as they would in their own game.. so unless you just wanna play for fun (or help your friend if you already play the game or anything) then multiplayer is really not worth... so yeah. the game is really good, great concept, good looking graphic, run pretty well on my pc (it doesnt struggle much which is good), and as a lot of content which is nice. so yeah I recommend the game but avoid buying it if it's only too play with your friend (that said, it is my opinion so maybe you would love it even if it'S only to play with your friends).",

            "review": "[h1] Review[/h1] \nInitially I was absolutely not interested in seeing a remake of a game I already played. When I played the demo back then I was really surprised how the game turned out to be. I really liked it although I still wished that they would port the original on steam too.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThis time the perspective is switched from fixed camera angles or first-person view to a third person angle. I love change that’s neat. Especially how the controls work, your character is not moving in any way stiff anymore not that I disliked the control scheme in any RE before.\n\nAlso, the puzzle nature of the gameplay is back, you run around and find obstacles and try to overcome them, mostly by punching in codes or finding an item, like a key(card) or a valve. Although more “complex” text puzzles of the original are gone. Still this gameplay was always what I liked, coupled together with the enemies and resource management. Which fight should I pick, should I risk a health item or ammo, or reload an old save? Veteran mode is this time the only one that has limited saves via cartridges again. I like that there is a challenging but not overly difficult veteran mode, although there is no difficulty above that.\n\nCombat is fun due to the extra challenges of manually aiming at zombies heads or other enemies that are out there.  They move unpredictable making it absolutely not an easy task. They took again the system with the personal defence weapons from RE1 remake, so the protagonist will stab someone and lose a knife if getting grabbed from the front.\n\nYou also find on your way upgrades for your weapons or completely new ones, along with a remake and improvement of the old games level design. Its very familiar but still completely different, especially in the lategame. I found the game absolutely fun from start to finish and cannot really complain much, aside maybe that the backtracking can be a bit too much and the feature that helps you highlight rooms which you completely cleared makes the game a bit too easy on the exploring. I rather wish it would only highlight either main quest items or only being on easy difficulty. S Rank will take you on highest difficulty 2 hours and 30 minutes. My first play through took me closer to 8 hours for a single character. Good length, not too short but not too long.\n\nThere are also a few challenges that unlock cosmetics (but there are barely any) or artwork and a couple of extra modes added on. Those extra modes are a minigame that brings you through mostly already seen places and is more combat focused by delivering a mini story. Neat. Sadly extra coop mode or some kind of mercenary mode the franchise is known for. Oh well.\n\n[u]Story[/u]\nAs in the original you can play through the game as either Leon or Claire. They have some different story aspects but play through most of the same areas. I would say about slightly over 1/3 of their storyline and gameplay is different. You also have the A and B route again, which changes almost nothing in the whole game, I even have the assumption that it changes less than the original did. Main difference is only the new main pistol as mostly ammo for that one will spawn and the starting area of the game. Some puzzles have barely changed and just make the game a bit shorter. This is an aspect they could have just skipped and probably added only so original fanboys are not mad that it didn’t got included.\n\n[u]Sound[/u]\nA bit of a let down is the OST. They played it very save by making the OST less interesting. like the original and instead made it much more environmental, save aside a few tracks. Its definitely fine but not that memorable.\n\nGame is available again in a ton of different dubbed languages. Also, the indoor sound design is really neat and the whole SFX they use was my highlight.\n\n[u]Graphics[/u]\nYou can tweak a lot on the graphical settings. I especially love and give them kudos for actually showing pictures that resemble various effects. In literally all games I deactivate lens flares and bloom, but the pictures showed me an effect I liked so kept it. Neat stuff!\n\nTo the graphics itself, the game can run on a potato but offers scaling that you can have problems even with very modern hardware. Its great that they added this amount of customization. Its not the best looking game, but full of details and little animation quirks, like when zombies are about to grab you but you kill them in the same moment they fall against you while the protagonist pushes them off their body or they try to dodge them.\n\n[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]\nI really absolutely enjoyed my playthrough. It’s a short game with lots of replay value which I absolutely like. The remake stays somewhat true to the original but offers so many new ideas and environments making it a must play for people who liked the ps1 game. The only downsides I have are a few nitpicks which are overshadowed by the fun core gameplay loop.\n\n8.5/10 Fantastic game\n",

And yet, what has arrived is both a great recollection of what has always worked for horror games along with enough new to feel modern and accessible. This should end up in classrooms as an example of how to refresh old games while retaining their identity.",

You get to play as both Leon and Claire in either order, giving you 4 games to play. The Only complaint I have is the 2nd playthrough has the same bosses and same puzzles to solve only to have you go face to face with the super tyrant even though he was supposed to have died during the 1st playthrough. Overall I rate the game 7/10. Story wasn't as believable with how the 2nd story works.",

Released in 2011, the game serves as the final chapter in the Ezio Auditore trilogy, following Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. \n\nThe story of Assassin's Creed Revelations revolves around the aging Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the Italian assassin who has become a legendary figure within the Assassin Brotherhood. The game begins with an older Ezio traveling to Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in search of answers and to uncover the secrets left behind by Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, the protagonist of the original Assassin's Creed game.\n\nIn Constantinople, Ezio becomes embroiled in a conflict between the Byzantine Templars, led by the ruthless and enigmatic Prince Ahmet, and the local Ottoman Empire, under the reign of Sultan Selim. Ezio also encounters a new love interest, a young woman named Sofia Sartor, who aids him in his quest.\n\nThroughout the game, players control Ezio as he explores Constantinople's vast open world, scaling buildings, engaging in parkour, and using his weapons and stealth abilities to eliminate targets. The gameplay features a combination of action, stealth, and puzzle-solving elements, and includes missions that take place in both the present day and the historical setting.\n\nOne of the key gameplay mechanics introduced in Assassin's Creed Revelations is the Hookblade, an upgrade to Ezio's Hidden Blade that allows him to navigate the city more swiftly, perform aerial assassinations, and engage in thrilling zip-line traversal. The game also introduces a new Tower Defense minigame, where Ezio must defend his Mediterranean Assassin Dens against Templar attacks.\n\nIn addition to playing as Ezio, players also take control of Altaïr at various points in the game, experiencing his memories through Ezio's perspective. These sequences shed light on Altaïr's later life and his involvement with the Masyaf Keys, ancient artifacts that unlock a hidden library containing profound knowledge.\n\nThe narrative of Assassin's Creed Revelations delves deep into the personal journey of Ezio as he reflects on his life, purpose, and the legacy he will leave behind. It also reveals important revelations about the ongoing conflict between the Assassins and Templars, bridging the gap between the past and the present.\n\nAssassin's Creed Revelations received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its immersive setting, refined gameplay mechanics, and the conclusion of Ezio's story arc. It is regarded as a significant installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise, providing players with a satisfying culmination to Ezio's tale while setting the stage for future entries in the series.",

I can really only recommend in it if you're already invested into the first 3 games of the series as this of course has some pivotal story telling in relation to the overall story. It also is more AC so I guess that's a bonus for it too, even if it's the worst of the series at the point of it's release.\n\nOverall the graphics are way improved over the first 3 titles, and the gameplay IMO feels the best here that it has up to this point in the AC games. That's pretty much where the good things end. The story is the weakest (and shortest) so far, the city it takes place in seems to be the smallest and also just the most boring with seemingly much fewer things to do than previous titles. Beyond that, I encountered 2 game breaking bugs and a slew of others that I'd consider unacceptable. The game breaking ones of course being absolutely dreadful and embarrassing. I wanted to rate the game higher, but after encoutnering the first game breaking bug within the first minute of the game (which requires deleting a random file from the install, confirmed by someone at Ubisoft nearly a decade ago and of course hasn't just been fixed), It was hard to give much more praise, then once the second game breaking bug happened at a fairly pivotal story moment it was a straw that broke the camels back (this bug required turning off any multi core running for AC Revelations and then playing the part of the story affected with sub 20 FPS due to this). These things were beyond unacceptable and with those along with just the game not being nearly as good as the previous 3 in the world/story department it just was a major let down replaying this again. \n\n",

I finally dove in a few months ago just to see if I would enjoy it. This is THE space survival game, no other game even comes close. If you're into survival games that is this is an absolute treasure. Not to mention the fact that they haven't done the whole Paradox thing and released 50 DLC at this point, all content has been free.\n\nMy ONE complaint, and it's probably just because I haven't spent enough time in the game. Is the whole \"Expedition\" mechanic. If you're familiar with Seasons from other big MMOs it's of the similar vein. I'm just not sure if \"I\" find them fun, doesn't mean that you wont of course.\n\nAs far as price goes, 60$ is a pretty steep cost. I personally try to buy everything on sale and rarely buy games at full price. The amount of content in this game though is easily more than your average two AAA combined, maybe even three.",

            "review": "I tried running the game on my MacBook, overall it's good, but there are a couple of highly annoying issues.\n\nTextures and objects on planets sometimes flicker, it happens randomly.\nThe game lacks dead zone settings for the gamepad, so my character sometimes moves forward on its own. This issue is only present in this game, as if there's no dead zone at all.\nThe game occasionally crashes, usually after 2-4 hours of gameplay.\nFor now, my rating is average, but if these issues are fixed, I will change it to positive.",

The overworld as a way to connect locations isn't a bad idea, but it does feel a bit too less developed. The named instances for the most part are fun to play, but the rest of the content is fighting in rather short arenas that don't differ that much throughout the game.\n\nThat's my main problem with the game: The actually written content you get is good, but it's clear that it was padded with a lot of same-ish encounters. Most quests in the overworld are 'Go to arena and get item' which gets boring very quick. For 20-30 bucks this game is okay, but not for 60. Oh and stay away from the DLC. It is not worth it at all.",

            "review": "[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nTo preface this review, I haven't currently finished the main story of the game, might make an update If needed by the end. I have only played Borderlands 2 before this and I have not played the DLC this game was based on. I'm playing 3 player co-op with friends, coming out of playing BL2.\n\n[b][u]Player Characters, Customisation[/u][/b]\nCharacter customisation was cool, It's fun being able to make a character and pick a voice, however the options feel a bit lackluster, especially when It comes to the hair and outfit. All the player character voices seem to be British but none of those voice actors are British and yeah, It Is noticeable lol. There are 4 voices and \"personalities\" but they all say the same things and act the same way. Whilst making your own character Is Interesting, the fact they all act the same sucks out the personality and charm that player characters had In the other games.\n\n[b][u]World and Setting[/u][/b]\nI loved the world going Into It, and a lot of the settings are absolutely gorgeous, they feel so colourful, fun and full of creativity, I adore them. But they feel too closed off. I think If the game played like a typical Borderlands, It'd feel so much better. I know the other game was instanced, but you FEEL It more In this game, as opposed to the instances being sort of walled off by gates and such, there's just an invisible wall here, and some of the levels are EXTREMELY small, and you feel really boxed In, and they get repetitive, especially for random encounters and side quests. \n\n[b][u]Story and Missions with the World[/u][/b]\nAnything that Isn't the main mission feels a lot more half arsed and boring, like no effort went Into that half of the game, but the main story section feels pretty well done SO FAR, with epic cutscene moments and fantastic world design, I just feel like my immersion Is ruined when I witness something amazing happen to the landscape, only to walk fourth Into It to run Into an invisible wall and get teleported to the DND board overworld. I get that the game Is a parody based on a DND board game, and It was kind of funny and cool but sometimes It just sucks you out of It, and feels a little lazy to some extent. I think If anything, DND players love immersion and getting sucked In, but that part takes you out of what's happening for a while.\n\n[b][u]Weapons and Combat[/u][/b]\nWeapons, armour, whatever, It's all okay I suppose. The design of some of the weapons are really cool, but everything feels somewhat weak. Grenades are exchanged for magic spells, which there are a variety of. I do enjoy some of the spells, they are definitely cool, but some feel weaker than others or difficult to control. Melee weapons feel TOO weak In this game, like you're getting all up In the enemies business just to do way less damage than just using a gun would do, It's like high risk anti-reward. \n\nThe store was confusing to me at first, I ended up accidentally selling all my equipped items because they show up with everything else you sell apparently LOL. The battle also feels unsatisfying compared to the last game with all the colourful numbers showing up as you fight the enemies, It feels really lacking In this game. I know the enemies are probably repetitive In all the games, but I just FEEL It more here for some reason, I'm so bored of killing skeletons, and now we're In a new zone, we're fighting crabs, which are really annoying, they are tiny, fast and have a shell that makes ur damage look like a joke. \n\nAnother issue with combat Is, we can never tell when someone has died In this game, we have to just say on com's that one of us died. In BL2, there'd be an indicator on your screen with a sound when someone died so you always knew, but I find myself missing It all the time In this game. Also there's small things like I swear there's enemies with explosives on their backs that don't explode when you shoot them but that might be a nitpick, It just feels lame.\n\n[b][u]Inclusivity[/u][/b]\nSomething I do like about the game Is how It feels more inclusive, I thought the range of characters and voice actors of different identities and ideals was pretty neat. You can also pick from a set of pronouns for your character. \n\n[b][u]DLC[/u][/b]\nI'm not sure If the other games did this, but the DLC also feels shoehorned In a bit, like you're shown a class that you can't use, or worlds you COULD access with the DLC even though you don't have It, and are just told to go to the store. Looking at the reviews for the DLC, I'm assuming that's not a good Idea.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nI'm probably forgetting some things I want to say right now, but It just boils down to feeling boring, boxed In and unsatisfying. You can't get immersed Into this world, It feels stringed together and like nothing connects. The concept It great and I LOVE the worlds and stuff they have In here, they could have make something Incredible here but It just fell a bit short, especially If you're comparing It to the other games In the franchise.\n\nThis game Is not worth the curiosity, even If you're a fantasy fan. The game Is WAY too expensive, even on half price It's around £30, which Is In the high price range for me and my friends, I can't even imagine having paid In full for this. I can't justify It even at the half-way mark, It sucks, now I feel guilty for getting all my friends to spend so much on It, and I'm feeling forced to keep playing It just to feel like I got my.. or \"our\" moneys worth. I dread having to play It, and can't wait for It to end.",

            "review": "The (base) game is not worth the 60€ price tag and probably not even the 30€ that I got it at. Skyrim with My Little Pony mod installed feels more Borderlands than this.\n\nThe story of the game follows the familiar Borderlands format, with two caveats: there's basically no NPCs that follow you through the story, which is incredibly short. Sure, Tiny Tina and the Bad Guy narrate your adventures, but you're not regularly interacting with any recurring NPCs and there's very few familiar faces scattered about. For example, I would've expected Roland and Mr. Torgue to play significant parts in the game, what with their relationships with Tina. NPCs, in general, are entirely forgettable, with some minor exceptions.\n\nWhile the overworld map that connects all of the different zones is a neat idea and I like the various items scattered across it, I feel that it is very lacking in execution and is thoroughly undermined by the fast travel system. Either the overworld or the fast travel system should not exist. Additionally, the approximately four or five maps that are there for the so-called combat/random encounters in the overworld get incredibly boring, incredibly fast. \n\nSpeaking of maps, they are all very generic fantasy natural-scenery maps: there's a bit of grasslands, woods, city, sea floor and pirate beach. These are all fine and dandy, but the variety is significantly lacking in comparison to prior Borderlands titles. There's no volcano or underground biomes, for example, and what maps are there are very unimpressive visually.\n\nThe maps feature four primary factions: skeletons, greenskins, fungi and coiled (naga). None of the four factions have distinct mechanics or gameplay elements; there's nothing along the lines of skeletaurs, goliaths or hyperion bots at least before whatever is the equivalent of TVHM in this game. Technically, there's also pirates and bandits, but these are barely even visually distinct from skeletons, let alone mechanically. Scattered between the forces of the main factions are some fantastical beasts, such as wyverns and dogfish, which do distinguish themselves from one another.\n\nWith the fantasy theme come spells, which replace grenades and come with an automatic recharge mechanic. While some spells are incredibly powerful and feel great to activate as they can destroy an entire wave of enemies and put a huge dent even into badasses, most spells are lackluster and usually worse than firing a gun. The variety of spells is pretty good, but I wish that anything besides fissures actually had any \"oomph\" at all. For example, meteors come with a significant cast delay and have _tiny_ impact areas by comparison and absurd recharge times to boot.\n\nAlongside spells there are the class-based skills. There are exactly three interesting skills: polymorph, invisibility and reaper of bones, though ambi-hextrous deserves an honorable mention for conceding that the spells are strictly more interesting than the action skills. Everything else is of the format \"press button to deal damage\", which is confusing at best considering how easily many of the action skills in Borderlands titles could have been reskinned with a fantasy theme. \n\nSkill modifiers also do not exist, which combined with the above leads to every class feeling basically the same despite having extremely distinct themes. Your choices are to either shoot at stuff or hit them with your sword/axe/mace. None of the skill trees feel like a substantial change to how I play the game.\n\nAs there is only a single skill tree for every class, an opportunity to \"multiclass\" is presented. This essentially means slapping on the passives from another class to your initially chosen class. Don't forget to google the skill trees before you lock in, because the game does not actually give you any indication as to what the choice entails beyond a \"this class is good at fire damage\" when choosing and I don't know whether it is even possible to choose again. Nor do I really care, because why would I when there is essentially no difference?\n\nYou can freely choose your character's body shape, pronoun and voice independent of one another, which is nice, I guess, if I cared about any of that and if all of them weren't so incredibly bland. I have always enjoyed the various quips, puns and dialogue of the Borderlands player characters, but that does not materialize here.\n\nAll characters look essentially the same and outfits — the visually most distinctive part of your character — are tied to your class mod. There seems to only be a small handful of variants, all of which look the same. If you thought you could be a robot-ninja-pirate, think again. The color/pattern alterations you can make to your outfit are also incredibly bland and require you to find them as drops from enemies or from collectibles scattered around the world. If you thought Borderlands 3 had bad customization options with the ugly-ass head and body options, you really don't want to see what Wonderlands has to offer.\n\nTL;DR: it's bland. Buying and playing the DLC again is a better use of your time and money.",

            "review": "Not sure why so many people complained about this game being too short, it took me over 40 hours to finish the story with still a few side quests to do and plenty of collectables left to gather. That's plenty of game and honestly it got a bit samey after a while anyway. After about halfway through you've pretty much seen all the enemy types in the game so the combat can get repetitive. That said it is also very fun if you're just after more Borderlands. The inclusion of spells is a nice change from grenades for the franchise, though I'll admit I pretty much used only 1 or 2 different spell types because having to hold down a button for several seconds looking at the point you want to cast a spell leaves you a vulnerable so got annoying. Good variety of classes and more interesting perk upgrades than usual.\n\nNow the bad stuff. The game is way too easy. I rarely died and if I did it was because I missed a jump or accidentally bashed an exploding barrel thinking it was a regular one. Most boss fights were over within a matter of seconds with no strategy needed to defeat them. Ammo crates are spammed every 5 metres you walk so you never run out of ammo and have to change weapon so you only do so when you get bored. The UI is pretty poor. For example, to put a way point down on the map you think it would make sense that you could just click on the map where your mouse cursor is right? Well apparently not, because you have to drag your mouse across the screen to move the map cursor to the point on the map you want the way point to be. It's really awkward. Also the characters in the game apart from Tiny Tina are really lame and annoying. Not quite as bad as in BL3 but not far off. It was cringe inducing stuff.\n\nThere's a good game to be had, but the incessant chatter from cringey dialogue and laughably easy combat makes it easy to forget that the core gun play is the only thing holding this game together.",

I missed this when it came out and didn't read any reviews because it's borderlands. The game is beautiful, the cross with D&D is fun, the over world I thought was a nice edition. I was taking my time doing lots of side quest and such and beat the game on accident. They put a lot of effort into the game so I can't understand why you wouldn't write a better story. Sad. If this was a ten dollar game sure, but full price for the rubbish story is a big disappointment. They want you to buy all this DLC when the game is shallow is a slap in the face. Shame.",

The story is ok with a lot of the humour that you would expect and some old favorites (or hated chars...hehe) returning for some banter along a board game, its not a bad move since this has been done in BL 2 with great success. However, it is quite shallow and since it is a board game it does not really engage me in the story, but it was ok, nothing special at all but ok.\n\nGunplay is great as usual, builds are fun to explore etc. But.... the DLCs are so bad I do not even have words for it, next time just add more items in the game with the patch and skip the teedious quests that takes away the tempo of the game and offers zero in interesting lore. The DLCs are pure shir, sorry for the language. They are all annoying to do compared to BL content overall and there is ZERO story or rewards to care about apart from some new items. \n\nLate game farm is not terrible. I will for sure spend more time doing more builds etc. But keeping track of gear in the stash with no possibility to word search etc. is a bit of a joke by now. Having multiple chars with one bank with sortiing and scrolling being the only options for overview is beyond bad. Lots of bugs still but that does not matter for me, yet, since none are game breaking. \n\nA really good game overall for new players (i think, if they only want to go through it and maybe spend a few hours more after last boss) but for BL standards I give it 6/10 since it could have been so much better.",

            "review": "First and foremost, the best thing about the game is the open world. They did an amazing job designing 18th century Paris with all the iconic buildings and historical locations. The city is so lively thanks to the crowd system tech they’ve used to create large populations. I spent much of my time simply exploring and enjoying the sights.\n\nBut other than that…everything else is just plain dull. The story is mediocre and Arno Dorian is one of the least interesting AC protagonists I’ve seen. The side characters and the villains are just as bland. The mission design is so boring and lacklustre, I had to practically drag myself through the game to finish it. \n\nThe new parkour system was extremely frustrating and sometimes not even responsive. Maybe there’s a learning curve to it, but I sure didn’t find it myself. The improved combat system is pretty decent and added some good difficulty to the gameplay.\n\nThe new customization options were fun. We get to change each clothing piece individually to create a unique look for Arno. There’re unlockable upgrades and skills as well. Some of them are pretty useful like the ability to disguise. Then there are redundant ones like environmental blending; why does Arno need to UNLOCK the ability to SIT on a bench? \n\nThere are some interesting side missions such as Paris stories and murder mysteries. The Co-Op missions were enjoyable; there’s still a decent player base so it wasn’t difficult to find people to play with.\n\nWhile writing this I still couldn't decide whether I would recommend this or not. So I’ll just say try it out when it's dirt cheap on sale. If you’re going through the series for the overarching storyline, this is easily skippable, as nothing significant happens in this game.  \n",

As for the main game itself, its amazing, hands down the best parkour once you get used to it, and as everybody knows stealth is amazing,the story could be better though. The graphics are still amazing to this day and the map is very fun to play with even if you just run around,parkour and help citizens by assassinating your enemies. Now, the glitches, I haven't had any game-breaking glitch, and they certainly don't occur that often, and most of them are some slight graphical errors, but in comparison to the game's launch, the glitches barely show up and at the least so far for me they haven't really impacted my game at all. Unity is probably one of my favorite assassin's creed games now, and 100% one of the ones i have the most fun in. Highly recommended, but you should wait for a discount since the game is quite old now and depending on when you're reading this stuff like the online community may not be active at all, or the servers may shut down (don't worry though! you can still do the missions solo to get the rewards). Overall, very fun game, 9/10 because I'm sad I didn't play it when online was even more active.",

            "review": "My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",

It never got me hooked for long enough to care. \n\nCombat feels clunky, same with climbing and moving in general. I can't recall how many times I died cause for some reason he didn't jump into a haystack or a ledge. \n\nArno's assassin suit looks pretty awful imo and no matter what I did, the suit always looked bad. \n\nI honestly doubt I'd bother with finishing this one - 4/10",

Also huge thumbs up for amazing creature designs.\nIt's not flawless, far from it, but out of all the Monster Hunter games I've played so far this one I enjoyed the most. I highly recommend picking it up should you have a chance to do so, even 5 years after the premiere.",

I would like to see more customization, but that's just me and there are different types of gears to choose from for the right conditions and monsters. Many cosmetics and animations to select from and purchase for my desires. Cool and adorable!\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u] could be tricky with the mouse and keyboard, but I prefer to play this on a game-pad since Monster Hunter is solely on consoles. Pairing up with other Hunters is bliss, and a handful of things to do as a team, making this experience an incredible journey in the [i]New World[/i]. A lot of grinding if you're looking for specific things.\n\nThe [u]Main Quest[/u] is engaging since you get to see the character you've created go through with the story and connect with the cast.\n\nOverall, [i]Monster Hunter: World[/i] is a beautiful game to get the feels of the franchise and I was glad to stumble upon this as my first experience: I never knew I could outplay an ego \"10-year veteran\" (at the time of release) within a matter of days! Great person to learn the game from, but too prideful regarding \"leadership.\"\n\nI veteran now. *slowly nods*",

World is paced more deliberately. Sometimes that can be good, other times it can be bad. Unfortunately it also extends to general QOL which Rise had. Why on earth you have to all watch unskippable cut-scenes separately in a game where co-op play should be encouraged is beyond me. I also dislike the way the long drawn-out tracking sequences function. Once again, it's okay when you're playing solo, but when you're trying to coop it's straight up \"wait half an hour while I go pick up these footprints\". \"Tracking\" a monster in itself isn't a bad idea, but I feel it should be a more interactive process going forward. As it stands, it just delays the story for an arbitrary amount of time and is designed to be completed passively whilst you grind gear. Why not give players the choice? Or make the tracking a team-based effort on a map? Just off the top of my head, Maybe the game could borrow ideas from Monster Hunter Stories 2, and have miniature locales branching off of the main map, \"dens\". Maybe a mini-game where you ultimately follow the trail to a den, where you could track down it's egg or some other precious item, leading to a confrontation with the monster.\n\nWhere World really shines is in all of the detail however. The things which the Nintendo Switch just does not allow for. The graphics are on the nose. But it's also smaller details like being able to capture a vast array of small creatures, then accommodate them at your house. Or, when you capture a monster and you can then see that monster sleeping in the village after the quest. It's little details like this which really elevate the game for me.\n\nI am not yet in a position to comment on combat or gear. I have just completed Iceborne, using the Switch Axe. I used Dual Blades almost exclusively for 800 hours in Rise/Sunbreak, and a small amount of Hunting Horn. I will look to compare those weapons more directly once fully in the endgame.",

            "review": "I've been playing the Monster Hunter franchise since the first game released on the PS2. I missed a few games in between because I didn't have a 3DS, but I had been playing MHFU on my PSP up until World came out. \n\nWorld, in my opinion, is what Capcom wanted Monster Hunter to be back in 2004 but were limited by the hardware of the time. I loved the old games and have fond memories of playing them, but when I go back to play them I can only stomach the old systems for so long before I return to World. I've played some of Rise but it honestly felt like a step back from World.\n\nAll in all it is an amazing game with great mechanics and a wide variety of play styles to choose from. I have a few gripes like the \"story\" being shoe horned into the game and the frustrations it creates when trying to play multiplayer hunts if you're not on the same page in regards to reaching the specific cut-scenes. Other than that minor gripe this is by far my favorite Monster Hunter game of all time and my 1782hrs of game time will only continue to go up.\n",

The gameplay is top notch it feels so fluid. The open world is perfect, there's tons of cool secrets to unfold. The game has a dope surprise if you defeat all the red enemies. The boss fights are solid. I played the first two DLC and they were pretty good although I expected more. Ill be coming back to play the other two DLC. Although the budokai games are special to me, I do have to say I think this is the best DBZ game I have ever played ! \n9/10 Amazing !!!!",

            "review": "[h1]Fantastic way to experience one of the most famous series in history.[/h1]\nIncludes all major plot points with far better graphics without some of the distracting fluff the original series had. That being said, it also includes some gameplay fluff that may be distracting but only if you let it.\nFor those that know nothing about Dragon Ball Z: This is an anime. Duh, right? So you can probably guess the graphics style. That being said, it is fully 3D and very well done- vastly improved upon the original series' graphics. Everything's in English, if wanted, and the storyline is a key feature of this game. You don't really need to know a whole lot about the series to enjoy this game. It is a fighting game, yes, but it feels more like a third person action RPG since there is a lot of character growth in levels, stats, and skills. I haven't beaten this game yet since I've let my son do more than half of the gaming hours I have put into it, but from what I've heard there is a lot of extensive character customization[spoiler[ after the game is won in a New Game+ fashion[/spoiler]. The fighting is very smooth and most of the time (hate it those few times whenever I can't interrupt my combo to dodge or block an attack) you can time things beautifully for a kickass experience. Fighting evolves throughout the game which is great if you want to compare it to Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, which is basically the same combos the entire game and only super skills changing. Awoken skills, or transformations as they're called in this game, also make a difference in your fighting style which makes perfect sense. You are also able to, but not required to after the first tutorial bit, upgrade your stats and gains using a Community of characters that specialize in different things to provide you with various long-term passive bonuses of your choosing. It works using a mechanic that is similar to a gift/relationship system, but you can do it from anywhere and almost at any time.\n\nThe big complaint I have about this game: It's not cooking like people mention, it's not grinding for items like others mention in their reviews (if you don't like grinding then play on an easier difficulty so you don't have to, ya foo), it's that even though you've achieved the experience levels and orbs (orbs work like a specialized experience resource in this game) to upgrade a skill there are still many times in which you have to have a break-out battle to \"train\" for the skill in order to learn it and use it. This is made a little worse in the way that you can't progress further in that part of your skill tree at all unless you unlock that specific upgrade through the break-out battle (obviously you're required to win it) needed to unlock that skill. Gets annoying, especially when you're in a part of the game where it won't let you locate and use a training node. [strike]Also, even though the new skill is better in every way it doesn't automatically replace the older version of the skill? Maybe people just don't want to use more ki, w/e who cares.[/strike]",

Don't worry about the game-breaking glitches that are listed in the reviews, the game runs smoothly now, and rarely has performance issues. If you loved the base game, then you should definitely get Iceborne. It adds a new mechanic that is super fun to mess with and comes with more challenging monsters to fight. At this point, I honestly can't see the base game without the DLC, it is quite honestly the perfect match up in terms of addon content. Iceborne is a little bit pricey (POV base game is cheaper), but it is still worth the $40 although I would wait for a sale-",

I would have attributed that to the abysmal launch that has been fixed up since then, but I suppose there are still quirks to the DLC people don't like.\nPersonally, I love it. It adds another bump in challenge and offers plenty of new content that bolsters the gameplay loop of the base game. The base game honestly suffers from the lack of Iceborne since it give late game gear a good stepping stone into Iceborne's steep difficulty spike. \nPoor launch state aside, if you enjoyed your time with the base game, you'll love what Iceborne brings to the table.",

It took a while to get the drinks because we're broke af, but hey, I got them few days later after I posted this. We never expected people to interact with this because the idea is just crazy, to our surprise it even exceeded our expectations. I also want to thank everybody for interacting and my friend for keeping his promise, I could never do it without you guys. We will never forget this legendary wholesome moment, maybe when I have the money, I should pay him back with some drinks.\n\n(About the game it's really fun with friends especially when you have a lot of crazy things to do, Los Santos has brought me so many unforgettable memories)",
