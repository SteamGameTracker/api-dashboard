The remastered graphics are a sin to its legacy.\n\n[b]Halo 2:[/b] Likely the best shooter ever created. My favorite in the series. I can't even put into words how much I adore this game. The story, characters, atmosphere, everything is just perfection! (Totally not bias) The remastered graphics did everything right and only enhance the game further!\n\n[b]Halo 3:[/b] Second only to Halo 2, another grand master of shooters, one of the best gaming experiences you can get! No other Halo has captured the same lightning in a bottle this game had. A golden era game.\n\n[b]Halo 3 ODST:[/b] Not my favorite, but by no means a bad game! Telling a great story from a perspective we've not seen before or since in the series.\n\n[b]Halo Reach:[/b] The final game from the Bungie era, a fantastic sendoff to the series. With crisp and more modernized gameplay, It tells a fantastic and gritty story leading up to the events of Halo CE. Yet another that can not be beaten.\n\n[b]Halo 4:[/b] The begging of the end. The first sign of Halo's terminal disease known as 343. The start of the series slow, painful death. Garbage in every way.",

Solutions online suggest you verify integrity of game files (done), cap fps at 60 for all players (done), and finally reconfigure your router settings so that all players have an 'Open NAT'. I remember reconfiguring my router settings 15 years ago to play Halo 3 online, it is asinine that this is still an issue. The MCC was released in 2020 and yet even now network issues persist. Reading through the Steam discussions, these connection errors are very common. I would refund this game if I still could. It is a bare minimum ask that a multiplayer-oriented game have functional co-op multiplayer, which the MCC does not.",

Two of the more standout issues are the memory leak in Halo CE, a major problem where it starts eating your ram like a pig at a candy trough and Halo Reach missing most of its ambiance on certain levels, notably Sword Base. Other issues include terrible netcode in campaign mode, good luck if you try to play anything other than 3 with a friend, lack of split screen, and lack of a dedicated Custom Games Browser that isn't shackled to Easy Anti-Cheat.",

            "review": "I waited at the midnight release for MCC to drop all the way back in 2014. I remember it being freezing outside as I waited in line at my local GameStop, back when it was cool to shop at GameStop. I could see my breath in the air and my hands were firmly cemented in my pockets to prevent them from dying and falling off. Minute by minute the clock ticked until it was 9 pm PST and the doors to my foreseen salvation would open. I walked inside, blinded by the LED light fixtures, and forked up the sixty dollars that stood between me and Halo 2: Anniversary. \n\nMy dad drove me home. I was numb the entire time, replaying that summer's E3 Microsoft presentation in my mind over and over again. Halo 2 multiplayer, JUST the way it came out of the box in 2004. I was much too young to play (let alone appreciate) what Halo had to offer back in 2004, but I had been a devout follower since 2009 when I got Halo 3: ODST wrapped up under the tree. Firefight and I had been inseparable. I devoured each and every piece of lore I could find in the game. I read and re-read Ghosts of Onyx at my local library after school whenever it wasn't already checked out. I was beyond ready to experience the Halo of yore, the Halo experience the kids older than me got, the Golden Age in a box. \n\nBut as it turns out, my enthusiasm was entirely misplaced. That fateful November night back in 2014, I first learned the definition of disappointment. \n\nThe game was in a state of disrepair. It was buggy, broken...unplayable. And it felt that way. You could see right through the cracks. Any of the campaigns had a 50/50 chance of loading in, if the game would even launch at all...and GOOD LUCK if you even dared venture into matchmaking. The Master Chief Collection was simply unfinished. \n\nBut, I was fifteen and much too loyal this franchise to give up immediately. I wasn't part of Jason Jones' jaded crowd yet. I stuck through the shattered mess, weeding my way through the code and patiently waiting for 343i to drop patch after patch. Eventually (a word most people who buy video games nowadays are unfortunately extremely familiar with), the game started to work as intended. Sure, matchmaking would still drop the ball most of the time but I could at least pop a grunt on Outskirts with a battle rifle as god intended. And let me tell ya, it felt great. Somehow, somewhere, underneath it all stood the masterpiece that wrote so many people's adolescence. It was there, however strained and tired from holding up all that rubble, but it was there. \n\nTime passed. I got older. I kept chugging away at this unfinished project, as essay left in the drawing room. It came time for me to admit defeat and put the controller down, uninstalling nearly 400 gb of patches that occupied the majority of my launch day Xbox One's paltry 500 gb hard drive. \n\nTime passed. I got older. I heard something weird. A little birdy told me that 343i was going to revamp their efforts at fixing the MCC. Strange. What's this about \"flighting\"? New content? Matchmaking updates? I was swayed into reinstalling the MCC and I got some of my friends to do so as well...and we had fun, we had a lot of fun. Lasering a full enemy warthog on Sandtrap had never been that much fun. \n\nI think it was E3 2019 when 343i revealed their plans to add Halo Reach and Halo 3: ODST into the mix. They even planned a PC port (hurray for Steam users!) I was busy getting jiggy on Last Resort at that time but I kept my eyes wide open for those new releases. And they happened, on time too. I had both Reach and ODST in the palms of my hand again and a game that (mostly) worked fine on the Xbox in 2020. Yet, my time with Xbox would be short lived after that, as a certain Cyberpunk 2077 released in an even worse state than the MCC did back in 2014. It crushed my dreams and firmly cemented my place alongside a 2003 era Jason Jones. I sold my Xbox, built a PC, and never looked back. \n\nHalo: MCC is by far my most played game on Steam to date. Matchmaking works well, customization is killer, and it's a miracle that this game finally feels optimized for the platform(s) that it's on. That Golden Era that held up the rubble for so long was finally relieved and allowed to shine as brightly as possible. Bungie's vision was carried over to the PC delicately and with much reverence. 343i had over ten years to get it right and one day (after enough community \"feedback\") they finally decided to get their affairs in order and bang this game into shape. I won't give them credit for that. \n\nIt's become disturbingly common in the current game landscape to launch an unfinished game and patch it into it's actual retail state and then coerce the players into \"thanking\" the devs for \"sticking with the game\"...when it should have launched complete in the first place. I understand the harmful crunch ethic that many publishing companies set for their devs, it is a DANGEROUS precedent. My heart goes out to every person in the industry that works tirelessly against the corporate schemes at bay. Please keep doing what you love, you just need to find a place that truly appreciates your talents. Consider unionizing perhaps, I dunno. But one thing is for certain, publishing companies need to let devs take more time to finish their games. I speak for the majority of consumers when I say \"please take your time, we can wait.\" \n\nAnd to 343i, you are one of the first offenders. You helped set this consumer-unfriendly business tactic of promising the world and dangling the nostalgia carrot, and then you swept the rug out from consumers' feet. You did this in 2014. You did this in 2015. You did this in 2021. Shame on you and Microsoft Games Studios. \n\nSo, to those who are wondering \"should I buy MCC?\", I say yes. It works. It's fun. It's the best way to play the Halo games on your computer (so far). Maybe wait for a sale if you're feeling frugal. The sins of 343i's past transgressions concerning the MCC have since faded and buying this game is not an indicator for where the market will go, it is an indicator for where the market SHOULD go. 6 solid and ever re-playable campaigns with a jam packed array of multiplayer modes and maps alongside a ridiculously detailed customization system that is easy to unlock just by playing the game. And it all just works. It has gone from a monument to all of the industry's sins to a beacon of hope for all of those that wish to return to simpler, pro-consumer times. A true metamorphosis. \n\nBut, I haven't forgotten that night in 2014. It replays in my head every time I launch the game. Above all, remember this prospective MCC owners: It should have released this way in 2014.",
