Deaths of most characters don't have an affect on much of the game, and there's only two endings which aren't exactly hard to get each and generally feel like a letdown.\n\nFun game, just not sure if it's worth the $25 price tag.",

            "review": "Having played only one play through so far, I have to recommend this game to anyone who loves 80s vibes, serial killers and the ability to hit keys on a soundboard at inappropriate times. Not only is it very immersive as a puzzle game, it hits all the sweet spots of horror without being too much. There's a very intricate mystery to solve, plenty of important choices - with sometimes startling consequences - and a really good chill to go up your spine. At the same time there's a lot of levity in the form of playing tunes, hoarding everything you can pick up at your desk and using a sound board to amuse yourself. \n\nThe dialogue choices, along with the important puzzle choices, dictate tone and results in the game that feel true to their weight. You can be under pressure sometimes but nothing's too hard to solve. Just... make sure to examine your clues thoroughly so you don't end up answering a quiz with only half the data. Speaking from experience. #sorryscott\n\nI'll be playing through at least 2+ more times for achievements, so the replay value is already astonishing. It took me about 6-7 hours for one play through and so that's the one thing I have to say about this game: it isn't short, and you don't feel short changed. It seems to have a lot to go through and is well worth the price!",

In a bizarre turn of events it turns out an old town legend known as \"the whistling man\" has began to kill again 20 years after his disappearance. The first victim is the towns sheriff, so her assistant needs to drive to the closest town for help. Sense all of the members of the police station are gone for the night you need to fill in for 911 and take in calls of desperate victims in need of help.\n\n It feels really fun playing as Forrest who's just trying to adapt to his new job and save callers from the town. All of the puzzles are unique and fun in there own way. I really enjoy the graphics as well, its like if borderlands was a horror franchise. The music to this game is outstanding and by far the best part of the whole game. It really feels like music that was made in the 80's. The dialogue is witty and fun, although a few jokes did fall flat for me. The game is decently scary thorough the whole game. When your not trying to save callers who are desperate for help, your exploring more creepy areas in the old radio station. The game is pretty long (taking me 5.2 hours to beat) and super small at only 2 gigabytes required for the whole game. I would give this game an 8.5/10 and if your looking for an entry to the horror franchise I absolutely 100% recommend this game. But if your a horror veteran looking for something extra spooky that will make you cry yourself to sleep, I would recommend something else. But if your looking to have a great time than this game is an excellent choice.",

            "review": "I've been looking forward to this game since playing the original game jam version on game jolt 3 years ago and it didn't just meet my expectations, but it vastly exceeded them. Killer frequency EXCELS at crafting a tense, tight atmosphere where it really feels like every decision matters, and is overall an incredibly enjoyable game on every front. The main characters have a wonderful synergy and consistently interesting banter, the radio host idea is executed extremely well, and the game manages to be absolutely TERRIFYING in the moments you're given control outside of your radio booth. A good majority of the time I knew I wasn't in any real danger, but the excellent audio design made me feel completely terrified anyway. The game's only real flaws I've dealt with are the fact I had a caller die and had absolutely no idea it happened until the end of the game tally (And had no idea what I had done wrong in that encounter considering every other member of the group was alive) and that caller retention seemed to be very minor outside of a select few, however with how many branches the game's choice making has it's completely understandable. I played the game completely in one sitting and can't recommend it enough, and will definitely be playing again.\n\nNow please put the soundtrack for sale because I really want to throw my money at it!!!",

With some fun puzzles thrown in. This isn't a expensive game give it a shot",

            "review": "This game rocks. Super suspenseful for a game where you basically never leave your tiny radio room, at least to start. It's quite similar to the classic horror game Do You Copy, but with a significantly expanded scope in all the best ways. Great voice acting and the dialogue gets everything that's happening on the phone lines perfectly, without sounding corny. The humor was overall good, and decently spread out, and best of all it knew when it was time to put the clown horn away because the story was getting too juicy to have another pizza break.\n\nThe one thing that's a bit irritating is that the first two calls are significantly more complicated to run through than the others, ESPECIALLY the second one which borders on Keep Talking And No One Explodes. Once you realize [spoiler]the game has only a few actual quick time events, and no matter what people say outside of those quick time events you have all the time in the world to figure out the puzzles,[/spoiler] the game gets much less nerve wracking. But that doesn't make it any less suspenseful. Super great stuff. Highly recommend, worth every penny.",

            "review": "[h1]Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version (including the online):[/h1]\n\nShorter version\n\nBuy this game if:\n\n✅ You're in love with and you want to dive into a heavily story driven Western game (which feels like a tv-series sometimes)\n✅ Open world exploration,shooting, side questing, item collection and completing ( sometimes long) challenges is something you’re interested in:\n✅ In case you want to enjoy online features at its fullest: you’re willing to spend 10€ or you local currency into it to avoid unfun early game grinding;\n\nDon't buy the game if:\n\n❌ (IMPORTANT) your PC’s spec aren’t meeting even remotely the average suggested requirements, as having proper graphics, light and game effects improve drastically the in-game experience and activities such as: shooting, resource gathering and hunting;\n❌ when playing open world games, you often engage only with the main mission stories and skip/leave aside the optional game content; \n❌ you’re looking for a straight online matchmaking or for a refined experience, as that mode was sadly abandoned and not further developed years ago. You’ll find more about online in the detailed section of this review down below;\n❌ (IMPORTANT) you don’t want to have a Rockstar account which is active and online while you’re playing as it’s mandatory;\n\nVerdict: 9 \n\nTime required to finish the single player game campaign: 30 hours \nTime required to complete it at 100%: 200/250 hours (took me 250 including online achievements)\n\nLonger version:\n\n[b]a) realistic and historical american environment [/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972922065\n\nRDR2 takes place by the end of the 19th century, in an imaginary area that could be generally summarized as a mix of Louisiana, New Mexico and Nebraska (or any other US state filled with a mountain type of environment).This excellent mix of different biomes is filled with hundreds of animals of all species; fauna itself is “real” in the sense that their behaviour and daily (and nocturnal) life are well represented and very close to reality (i.e. you’ll see owls flying into the night mostly, different temperatures etc…). You’ll really feel like living in a beautiful yet hazardous country, enhancing even more the immersion and the narration.\n\nAnother great touch of realistic fauna: when hunting animals, different weapons and ammunition, along with the animals’ body parts that will be hurt will lead to different results when hunting, for example shooting a rabbit with a shotgun will destroy the carcass, while using a bow with a precise shot or headshotting it with a low calibre rifle will allow you to skin the animal properly and get a higher quality pelt and more edible meat quantity.\n\nFunny side note: horses will p00p. A lot. Often. Consider yourself warned.\n\n\n[b] b) Clothes, voice acting and face cameras:[/b]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972367589\nGiven how accurate and detailed the clothing (of all kinds, even the pijamas!) is (and not only that) the immersion is made much deeper, thanks also for the countless hours spent by the developers’ team and the actors/actresses while animating the characters while in game and during the cinematic cutscenes;\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972965029\n\n[b]c)\tNarration and gameplay: (dis)honorable choices and (grey) remarkable characters:[/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972612738\n\nRDR2 has a “honor bar” system, which goes up when helping people, being honest or being merciful and goes down while being the opposite, impacting both how NPC perceive you, in part how the game will end and how your companions and surroundings will interact with you; all the characters…are quite remarkable and deep, the whole roster of people have all their own story and background, even those who don’t see much screentime or play an important role in the story…it’s almost impossible to not be or become somewhat fond of them or even not remotely interested in their stories and epilogues.\n\nThe narration is extremely fluent and hits hard thanks also to its main protagonist - Arthur Morgan – which is one of the best fictional video games characters I’ve ever seen in my experience due to his versatility, his falsely crass (yet extremely fun at times) attitude, his sarcastic comebacks and his overall growth, in every aspect.\n\n\n[b]d) Red Dead Online, few important points to mention :[/b]\n\nThis game mode is set up in the same world that you’ve spent your single player campaign, sadly whether you’re going to play to get the online achievements only or to just enjoy it for the sake of it, my advice is to buy some online currency and unlock two specific roles (collector and bounty hunter) to be over with the online as quickly as possible. To be more clear and specific:\n\n1- there are microtransactions, worsened by the fact that the cost of each item on online mode is multiplied excessively in comparison to its single player counterpart;\n2- is it possible to farm online currency with daily and weekly activities but in a really slow pace, which really doesn't go well with the nature of RDR2 online which allows for free roaming, but becomes chaotic pretty quickly;\n3- there are many griefers and cheaters on online servers, which can slow your progress, even though changing servers usually gets your rid of those annoying people;\n4- the online gamemode could have seen some more love, sadly GTA online was/is too profitable to be put away in favor of this one, probably harder to be managed/modded and rectrated due to its historical setting;\n5- as soon as you'll join online mode you'll be swarmed and overwhelmed by ingame messages,tutorials, tips and quests, making the learning curve quite brutal. I'd recommend playing 5-10 hours of single player campaign before going online;\n6- most of the fun online is made by roles, which are \"licenses\" which will unlock you key rewards, new activities and game modes. Sadly those are behing a paywall, literally. \n7- some online items (example: clothes, horses and equipment items) aren't into single player mode, which is a shame, but this happens when the online experience isn't as well thought of as the single player one;\n\n\nThanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night, feel free to follow my other reviews at: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32344423/",

And I like it! Every member of the Van der Linde gang feels like a real person with their own distinct personality and backstory.

This game is an absolute masterpiece and one of the best games I have ever played. The attention to detail in this game is incredible.

[b][i] Do note that I don't usually write a review or make an essay out of it but this game deserve one!. [/i][/b] The game itself is very immersive probably one of the best I've experienced. The landscapes are awe-inspiring, from the rugged mountains to the rolling plains, each with its own distinct atmosphere and beauty. The attention to detail is staggering, with dynamic weather and realistic animal behavior breathing life into the surroundings. It's a world that basically begs players to explore.\n\n[b] Development [/b]\nThe greatest thing R2D2 have to offer is the deeply engrossing character development of Arthur Morgan. As a member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur is a complex protagonist with a troubled past and a conflicted moral compass. Through the course of the game, players witness his transformation from a loyal outlaw blindly following his leader to a man questioning his actions and searching for redemption. The writing and voice acting are exceptional, capturing the nuances of Arthur's personality and emotional growth.\n\n[b] World Immersion[/b]\nThe open world is filled with diverse missions, side quests, and activities that complement the overarching story. Whether engaging in intense shootouts (as always~), doing heists, or simply exploring the wilderness, the gameplay remains consistently captivating. I have over 70+ hours now and I haven't even complete my first playthrough (due to exploring the map, side-activities and irl education/work). With all that, there are still things which I have yet too discover! Like who is Gavin??!\n\n[b] TRY IT! [/b]\nWhether you're drawn to the allure of the Wild West or simply appreciate a masterfully story driven game, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute must-play. While writing this down I should also note that Arthur Morgan is hands down the best protagonist out there!<3\n\n왜 아직도 읽고 있니? 이미 구입!\n그리고 모두 즐겁게~~",

            "review": "[h3]Now THIS is how to tell a story.[/h3]\nRed Dead Redemption 2 features the most gripping narrative I’ve ever seen in a video game. The epic journey of Dutch Van der Linde's gang of outlaws is full of so many jaw-dropping, cinematic, action-packed moments, but still stays believable as the protagonist Arthur Morgan slowly frees himself of his life-long gunslinger ideals. And every character in the Van der Linde gang’s saga feels remarkably human, thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting that perfectly complement this game’s stunning visuals, detailed animation and beautiful music.\n\nAll of these elements combine to make the world of Red Dead 2 come alive in a way that no other open world game does. The massive five-state map is incredibly dynamic, with missions, side quests and random events of equally high quality perfectly interwoven into an enchanting world that constantly changes with the flow of the main story. And there are so many little details throughout this game - from memorable NPCs to colorful customization options to fleshed-out minigames - that make the experience feel authentic.\n\nEven though I absolutely loved the phenomenal story and atmospheric world of Red Dead 2, the gameplay mechanics can seem shallow when taken out of context. Granted, there’s nothing wrong with the core controls - the shootouts are fun even on controller thanks to the Deadeye time-slowdown ability, and riding around on a horse is simple but satisfying. However, responsive controls are sometimes de-emphasized in favor of handholding gameplay and \"realism\" in regard to difficulty and mission structure. Horses automatically steer themselves on rough terrain, animations make looting and crafting take longer, many missions include trailing sections so the player can get where they need to go… et cetera.\n\nUsually, when a game prioritizes realism over immediate gameplay like this, there’s a weak link somewhere that breaks my immersion - such as bad voice acting, weak writing, faults in sound design or visuals, or spacing of content around the map. And this usually results in these “realistic” game mechanics becoming more tedious than they are immersive, distancing me from whatever atmosphere is trying to be established. But.. this isn’t the case with Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\n[h3]Red Dead 2 might be the first game to [i]fully convince[/i] me of its own world's authenticity.[/h3]\nThe immaculately detailed world and unbelievably human characters of RDR2 breathe life into in-game tasks that I would normally consider boring, like trailing missions, herding animals and catching fish - making even these less inspired gameplay segments pretty damn fun. The gameplay mechanics aren’t untouchable on their own, but the sixty-hour-long story pretty much is, and it’s paired with an intricate portrayal of 1899 America that makes the narrative just as enthralling as some of the greatest movies and TV shows ever made. This commitment to realism and thorough storytelling makes even the slower paced segments of the game exciting, and the intense parts (like shootouts) more meaningful.\n\nI’m already partway through my second playthrough now, and I’m having even more fun this time around trying to dissect the incredible character dynamics and details of the open world now that I’ve beaten the game already. The more I play Red Dead 2, the more fascinated I am with the spectacular story and cast of characters - and the few issues I originally had with the mechanics have become less and less noticeable in the grand scheme of RDR2’s monumental scope. Rockstar has created a true masterpiece here, and the gripping tale of outlaw Arthur Morgan is a story I’ll never forget. 10/10",

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This <strong>Alliance</strong> will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering <strong>Vagabonds</strong> who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.<br><br>Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling <strong>Eyrie</strong> have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.<br><br>The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Header_GameFactions.png?t=1680196419\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_DeCat_Button.png?t=1680196419\" /><br>The most recent conquerors of the forest, the <strong>Marquise de Cat</strong> plays a game of engine building and logistics while policing the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to build Workshops, Sawmills, and Recruiters to help her score victory points. Marquise de Cat has the largest army in ROOT, but numbers alone won’t be enough to secure the forest...<br><br>The Marquise de Cat builds a mighty industrial war machine to subdue the forest. Each time the Marquise builds a Workshop, Sawmill, or Recruiter, you score victory points. The more of the same building she has on the map, the more points scored. However, to fuel ongoing construction, the Marquise must maintain and protect a strong, interconnected economy of Wood. While it may be tempting to overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers, this leaves you at great risk of spreading yourself too thin and ultimately not being able to keep up.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Eyrie_Button.png?t=1680196419\" /><br>The <strong>Eyrie Dynasties</strong> once ruled the wood, before the coming of the Cats. They must retake control by capturing territory and building Roosts before they collapse back into squabbling. The Eyrie are proud and bound to the decrees of their leaders. Each leader brings with them different specialties and advantages. The right leader at the right time could lead you to victory, but the wrong leader could cripple your chances of reclaiming the forest.<br><br>During the Evening, the Eyrie score victory points based on the number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence in the Woodlands, the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn, they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Alliance_Button.png?t=1680196419\" /><br>The <strong>Woodland Alliance</strong> doesn’t take kindly to despots - old or new. Marquise, Eyrie, they’re all the same. Only through the will of the people can this wood be ruled! The Woodland Alliance are masters of guerrilla warfare, they begin slowly but can build into a late-game powerhouse - but only if they can manage to subvert the other would-be rulers along the way.<br><br>The Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various creatures of the forest. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more victory points they score.

Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This <strong>Alliance</strong> will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering <strong>Vagabonds</strong> who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance’s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.<br><br>Meanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling <strong>Eyrie</strong> have found a new commander who they hope will lead their faction to resume their ancient birthright.<br><br>The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Header_GameFactions.png?t=1680196419\" /><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_DeCat_Button.png?t=1680196419\" /><br>The most recent conquerors of the forest, the <strong>Marquise de Cat</strong> plays a game of engine building and logistics while policing the vast wilderness. By collecting Wood they are able to build Workshops, Sawmills, and Recruiters to help her score victory points. Marquise de Cat has the largest army in ROOT, but numbers alone won’t be enough to secure the forest...<br><br>The Marquise de Cat builds a mighty industrial war machine to subdue the forest. Each time the Marquise builds a Workshop, Sawmill, or Recruiter, you score victory points. The more of the same building she has on the map, the more points scored. However, to fuel ongoing construction, the Marquise must maintain and protect a strong, interconnected economy of Wood. While it may be tempting to overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers, this leaves you at great risk of spreading yourself too thin and ultimately not being able to keep up.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Eyrie_Button.png?t=1680196419\" /><br>The <strong>Eyrie Dynasties</strong> once ruled the wood, before the coming of the Cats. They must retake control by capturing territory and building Roosts before they collapse back into squabbling. The Eyrie are proud and bound to the decrees of their leaders. Each leader brings with them different specialties and advantages. The right leader at the right time could lead you to victory, but the wrong leader could cripple your chances of reclaiming the forest.<br><br>During the Evening, the Eyrie score victory points based on the number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence in the Woodlands, the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn, they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Alliance_Button.png?t=1680196419\" /><br>The <strong>Woodland Alliance</strong> doesn’t take kindly to despots - old or new.

But you will need to pay 40€ for all the content that the game proposes, and wait an hour for a game where the host will ragequit midgame or last second. The content that you will have without the dlc is too little, and the fact that people will not get punished for leaving the game makes the experience so hazardous. You have to bet that the next one hour long game will be funny, and that you are not wasting your time waiting 30 minutes for a match that will never ends. If all the content would be here for 20€, I would not complain. But the risk to not have fun is to pricy for my taste. Sorry.",

            "review": "It has high potential, but at the moment, many semifinished systems killing the fun in my opinion:\nFirst the good things: the idea of 3d building of a medieval settlement is really nice, and you become proud of your build (and sometimes even beautiful) structures. \nbut now the sad part: :-(\nthe temp. system keeps only warmth in, not coldness. so you have to dig like a mole to the ground to keep your food fresh. But the cellar had to be with dirt walls and twig floor, because of the random set heat isolation factors:\nWalls: dirt 0%, wood 60% , clay 93%,stone 70% and stonebricks 75%\nFloors: dirt 0% (but pushes rotting), wood 94%, twigs 40%, stone 70% and stonebricks 90% \nBuildingactions: your settlers often fix themselves in a wall or digging all fields arround them and than starve on their created \"Pile of idiocracy\". I don´t wanna know how often they will burn themselves to ashes, when the feature gets implemented^^\nterraforming: there often spawn some resources from digging through vains. and the settlers often dig from above. when the mats are spawning in the hole, and there is no path on the same ground lvl. Now you have to build a ramp or a pathway, to get the stuff away from there, because it blocks the filling of the hole. \nTasks: the settlers have only a small amount of \"task-categories\". So \"cooking\" means foodmaking, butchering, fermentation, smoking. But often your dead animals rots to pieces and you have no food, because high chief Jolanda is running thrugh the whole map to pick up some berries to make wine^^\n\nI was really sad after I realized, how often I had to fix stupid behavior of my settlers. \nBut maybe, I just have to high expectations, because of my expierience of (modded) rimworld. I hope. the ultimate castle building/settlement simulator of my dreams will come true, when I test it aggain in a few months. I wish for the developers, which created a cool basement with enormous potential \n",

            "review": "[b]Meme review:[/b] Nami-swan and Robin-chan are just too beautiful and even more so with the \"proper\" mods, you know which ones i'm talking about. 10/10 game, get it nao!\n\n[b]Actual opinion:[/b] DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... unless you are a hardcore One Piece fan.\n\n\nI can already feel the stares full of hatred from the other franchise fans, but listen here - as a Monkey D. Luffy \"imaginary nakama\" for over 20 years now - I can't in a good conscience rope an unsuspecting passersby into playing this game. I honestly was going to downvote the Odyssey, but then Nami-sama has told me that she won't do the \"happines punch\" anymore, so you should understand - my hands were tied and I just had to upvote the game as her faithful slave. But at least i will explain here what are the game's problems and why you should probably avoid it, unless you are a fan yourself.\n\nFirst of all - the game does not explain NOTHING about it's setting to the player. From the very beginning the Odyssey expects you to know everything about the One Piece world, the Grand Line, the Luffy's crew composition, adventures and desires, about the devil fruits and their rules, about the world government and it's dirty secrets and many-many other things. Even though the game's story is tied to the world of memories, where Luffy and his friends will \"re-live\" some of their older adventures - those \"arcs\" are made with so many things cut off and unexplained, that a non-fan player will be as baffled about the stuff that happened there after finishing them, as he was before that. The game was made for the franchise fans first and foremost after all, so if you actually want to enjoy the plot there is only one advice i can give to you - read the manga  first (or watch the anime, but reading will be faster considering the lenght of the story).\n\nSecond. Okay, maybe you don't care about the story or plot at all, and just want a basic gameplay satisfaction? At it's core the Odyssey is a typical party-based and turn-based j-rpg. The combat system by itself is okay, i don't have any major complains about it. Rock-paper-scissors vulnerability types, very well animated moves and attacks, an ability to change the team composition mid-fight - good stuff. The problem is what you are doing between fights... You are running. Back and fourth. In circles. Visiting and re-visiting the same locations again and again, grinding money, resources and exp, doing side-quests that require you to... yeah re-visit the locations you have thoroughly explored already. It's very tiresome. I literally felt how my will to play the game has been sucked out (and not in a \"good\" way) by this soulless gamedesign during the playthrough. If it was not the One Piece world, but some generic fantasy setting with the characters that i have no attachment to - i 100% guarantee you, that i would have abandoned the game half-way through. And judging by the steam achievements - many players actually did, because only the 10% of the game owners actually finished it.\n\nIn my opinion confusing setting + tedious and boring gameplay are reasonable enough for the non-invested gamer to avoid the Odyssey. But what about the actual franchise fans?\n\nWell, yeah, in that case there is no other choice but to play it. Graphics are quite impressive, especially the characters. It's like a real-life anime, bruh! Suuuper! But even in that case i do have a few smaller complains to file.\n\nWhile the 3D models are really cool and the colors and environment are faithful to the original - the whole Odyssey world is just a dead and motionless decoration or stage backdrop if you will, there is no life in here. Take any good modern game now - there you will see a walking crowds, some simple events unfolding without the players interference, mechanisms moving, etc etc. Here? Everyone, aside from territory-patrolling enemies are just glued to the same spots, waiting for the player to come and interact. Nothing moves by it's own will, nothing lives. And it's really a shame because the world of One Piece is so vibrant, teeming with life and events! But not here, no. Welcome to the Madame Tussauds wax museum.\n\nCharacter outfits is my another complain. If you bought the basic edition - you will have the same outfits for the whole game's lenght. The travelling outfits dlc can unlock the pre time-skip versions of costumes. But this is all. WTF? If you follow Oda's work for long enough - you shall know that for every story arc characters have some special costumes and new outfits to match the mood of events. I was totally expecting, that after completing the Arabasta, Dressrosa or any other memory world/arc player would unlock the corresponding outfits, after all we even have a special tent specifically for the costume change. F**k you and your expectations says Bandai Namco. Thank God we are the PC master race crowd and unlike the console plebs we can use the mods to solve this issue. But still it's a very disappointing decision from the developer.\n\nAnd while we are on the topic of mods, there are 3 main ones that i have to recommend you to install, to make your overall expirience with the game better:\n1 better/alternative costumes for characters. this is self explanatory.\n2 jiggle physics. YES. THIS. IS. MANDATORY. you will not regret it.\n3 run speed increase. with the amount of running you will do from A to B to C in this game - it will save you a few hours of your time, otherwise spend on simple running back and fourth.\n\nWhile this game has a number of issues - it's still by far the best One Piece game in existance to date (yeah, previous were way worse imo). For a franchise admirer, even despite all my rant, it's worth a buy to at least enjoy the close-ups of the favourite characters and some of their banter. But for an outsider - it's a typical mediocre j-rpg and if you are into the j-rpg's there are better time sinks around, like the \"trail\" or \"atelier\" series, Tales of Arise or the soon to be released FF-XVI.\n\nSo, in conclusion:\nOne Piece fan? Buy it.\nNot a fan? Skip it, you won't lose much.",

            "review": "I have completed the game, including all of the achievements.  The following is my fair assessment of the game's strengths and weaknesses, and I trend towards the technical, especially when it comes to nitpicks.\n\nShort version: If you aren't a One Piece fan, you might want to give this one a miss.  Enjoyment of this game is extremely dependent on this factor.\n\nAs a JRPG, this game is extremely laid back.  You will not find any real challenge until the very end, and then essentially only with the optional content outside of the story.  This was definitely one of my main gripes with the game.  But I eventually realized that this was done in order to keep the gameplay loop from interfering with the story progression.  By and large, the game is balanced so that as long as you defeat every map enemy you see exactly once, you're set.  Balanced both in terms of enemy difficulty and tolerable enjoyment.  By that I mean this game doesn't inspire a desire to grind for levels, nor does it require this from the player.\n\nThe story is exactly what you would expect: A contrivance is conjured to provide an excuse for the Strawhats to relive the events of the story, just as generally occurs in the Pirate Warriors games.  There is a LOT of dialogue from just about everyone in the anime.  Enough to fill a season.  This helps considerably in selling the idea that you're taking part in the anime.\n\nThe combat has a surprisingly functional gimmick that perpetually inspires the player to do more than hit attack—fights simply take too long to finish if one is literally that lazy.  And here is where the game's biggest strength shines: The character animations for various attacks are extremely well done.  Easily the highest tier of competence in the game was lavished right here.  This turns out to be important, since fighting ends up being about half of what they player does in this game.\n\nThe music is serviceable with the occasional shining moment.  It's certainly not completely forgettable, but also not something you'd add to your playlist.  It's about as good as, say, the average Sakuraba OST—this is not praise, but not a condemnation.  It would have been surprising if the soundtrack had been amazing, but I wasn't expecting it to be.  As is tradition with anime-turned-game, there are ZERO references to the anime's music, front to back.\n\nSound effects are about on par here.  Just like with the music, even when there were definitely certain sounds that are always used in the anime for certain moments—such as Sanji's air hop, or the sound of Law's Room ability—the game doesn't tap those sounds and instead just comes up with something of its own.  Disappointing, but entirely within precedent.\n\nThis game uses an accessory system that has no meaningful balance.  In a game where difficulty simply does not come into play, it could be argued that a lack of balance doesn't matter.  Indeed, I just about ignored the accessories until I reached the end of the game and began grinding out the remainder of the levels, at which point I went about as ham as I could with making my characters overpowered... because the endgame/post-game is the only time when the content is actually truly balanced against those accessories.  This feels like the correct way to approach the accessory topic: Don't pay much attention to them until you reach the end, and then go crazy.  It's satisfying that the game DOES give the player a reason to grind out some powerful accessories, if only at the very end.\n\nExploration is there, but not much rewarded.  Things are only rarely cleverly hidden.  Luffy gets a haki detection ability that's intended to find hidden items, but actually discovering anything with said ability is extremely rare and, if you will pardon the mild spoiler, almost entirely limited to moments when you've fought a new boss—you almost invariably locate their codex entry if you do a search.  Since there are no rewards or achievements tied to this, the only incentive is headcanon completionism.  The same thing goes for finding hidden items that only Sanji and Nami can see: They're there, at least, but you get nothing unique out of it, the game doesn't reward you, and it's all headcanon.  The exception to this is Robin, whose hidden items are required if one is interested in finishing the game's list of tasks.\n\nSmall nitpick: This is the kind of game that will inexplicably hide food items and ingredients in chests.  Meaning you'd better be prepared not to treat this game as something immersive.  Treasure chests tucked away in dungeons for who knows how long will very frequently contain MEALS.  Meals which SHOULD have been something only Sanji could prepare for you.\n\nThe graphics are better than I expected them to be.  With a 3080, the game can be played at a flat 4K 60fps from start to finish, and the only hiccups I ever saw were in the \"strange place\", possibly because the room is very busy and shows every crew member simultaneously.  Unfortunately, because the engine is UE4, one has very little choice but to use temporal anti-aliasing, which always causes afterimages on objects moving in contrast with the background.  Comically, the pre-rendered cutscenes, which always play at 30fps, were very clearly rendered in UE4 themselves, as they ALSO reveal the artifacting characteristic of TAA.\n\nMy recommendation of this game is a bit like how I might recommend a One Piece movie: It's a spinoff, but it treats the property with respect and care, it uses the real voice cast fair and square, and it has a pretty high production value.  Fans of the anime are the target audience.  Pure JRPG fans should probably stay away unless you're out of options and need that blank filled.",

Unfortunate for a game I was extremely hype for, 90% of the moves are the exact same with the same effects but different damage numbers, meaning using anything other than your best it pointless because your resource can be charged up in basically 1 turn. I've enjoyed pretty much all one piece games i've played by this one falls flat. The Story and characters are extremely predictable and nothing really new was added. There was a scene in dessrosa that felt very ham fisted as nice as it was. (you know what i mean if you've played) and if you haven't don't.",

            "review": "[b]Positive Points[/b]:\n\n➜ Delivers an intense cooperative experience where players team up to survive waves of horrifying enemies. The game's focus on teamwork, communication, and strategy adds depth to the gameplay, making it highly engaging and satisfying.\n\n➜ Combat is fast-paced, visceral, and improved compared to its predecessor. The game offers a wide variety of weapons with detailed animations and realistic gunplay. The addition of melee attacks, gore effects, and dismemberment mechanics further enhances the combat experience.\n\n➜ Introduces a wide array of enemies, each with unique abilities, behaviors, and attack patterns. From hulking brutes to agile crawlers, the diverse enemy types keep the gameplay fresh and challenging, requiring players to adapt their strategies and weapon choices accordingly.\n\n➜ Impressive visual and audio design. The detailed environments, high-quality textures, and atmospheric lighting create a dark and immersive atmosphere. The sound effects and music heighten the tension and contribute to the overall intensity of the gameplay.\n\n[b]Negative Points[/b]:\n\n➜ Primarily focuses on its core gameplay mode, which involves surviving waves of enemies. While this mode is enjoyable, the game lacks additional modes or variations, potentially leading to a sense of repetition over time.\n\n➜ Similar to its predecessor, lacks a strong narrative or significant character development. The game's primary focus is on gameplay and cooperative action, so players looking for a rich story-driven experience might find it lacking in this aspect.\n\n➜ Can have a steep learning curve. The game does provide some tutorials and guidance, but mastering the mechanics, understanding enemy behavior, and effectively coordinating with teammates can take time and practice.\n\n➜ Primarily designed as an online multiplayer experience. While there is an offline mode available, it lacks certain features and can feel less engaging compared to the cooperative online gameplay.\n\n[u]Killing Floor 2[/u] excels in delivering an intense and challenging cooperative shooter experience. With its improved combat mechanics, diverse enemy variety, impressive visuals, and immersive sound design, the game offers hours of thrilling gameplay. While the limited gameplay modes, lack of narrative depth, steep learning curve, and limited offline play may be potential downsides, fans of cooperative shooters and intense action will likely find Killing Floor 2 to be an enjoyable and worthwhile game.",

The overworld as a way to connect locations isn't a bad idea, but it does feel a bit too less developed. The named instances for the most part are fun to play, but the rest of the content is fighting in rather short arenas that don't differ that much throughout the game.\n\nThat's my main problem with the game: The actually written content you get is good, but it's clear that it was padded with a lot of same-ish encounters. Most quests in the overworld are 'Go to arena and get item' which gets boring very quick. For 20-30 bucks this game is okay, but not for 60. Oh and stay away from the DLC. It is not worth it at all.",

            "review": "[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nTo preface this review, I haven't currently finished the main story of the game, might make an update If needed by the end. I have only played Borderlands 2 before this and I have not played the DLC this game was based on. I'm playing 3 player co-op with friends, coming out of playing BL2.\n\n[b][u]Player Characters, Customisation[/u][/b]\nCharacter customisation was cool, It's fun being able to make a character and pick a voice, however the options feel a bit lackluster, especially when It comes to the hair and outfit. All the player character voices seem to be British but none of those voice actors are British and yeah, It Is noticeable lol. There are 4 voices and \"personalities\" but they all say the same things and act the same way. Whilst making your own character Is Interesting, the fact they all act the same sucks out the personality and charm that player characters had In the other games.\n\n[b][u]World and Setting[/u][/b]\nI loved the world going Into It, and a lot of the settings are absolutely gorgeous, they feel so colourful, fun and full of creativity, I adore them. But they feel too closed off. I think If the game played like a typical Borderlands, It'd feel so much better. I know the other game was instanced, but you FEEL It more In this game, as opposed to the instances being sort of walled off by gates and such, there's just an invisible wall here, and some of the levels are EXTREMELY small, and you feel really boxed In, and they get repetitive, especially for random encounters and side quests. \n\n[b][u]Story and Missions with the World[/u][/b]\nAnything that Isn't the main mission feels a lot more half arsed and boring, like no effort went Into that half of the game, but the main story section feels pretty well done SO FAR, with epic cutscene moments and fantastic world design, I just feel like my immersion Is ruined when I witness something amazing happen to the landscape, only to walk fourth Into It to run Into an invisible wall and get teleported to the DND board overworld. I get that the game Is a parody based on a DND board game, and It was kind of funny and cool but sometimes It just sucks you out of It, and feels a little lazy to some extent. I think If anything, DND players love immersion and getting sucked In, but that part takes you out of what's happening for a while.\n\n[b][u]Weapons and Combat[/u][/b]\nWeapons, armour, whatever, It's all okay I suppose. The design of some of the weapons are really cool, but everything feels somewhat weak. Grenades are exchanged for magic spells, which there are a variety of. I do enjoy some of the spells, they are definitely cool, but some feel weaker than others or difficult to control. Melee weapons feel TOO weak In this game, like you're getting all up In the enemies business just to do way less damage than just using a gun would do, It's like high risk anti-reward. \n\nThe store was confusing to me at first, I ended up accidentally selling all my equipped items because they show up with everything else you sell apparently LOL. The battle also feels unsatisfying compared to the last game with all the colourful numbers showing up as you fight the enemies, It feels really lacking In this game. I know the enemies are probably repetitive In all the games, but I just FEEL It more here for some reason, I'm so bored of killing skeletons, and now we're In a new zone, we're fighting crabs, which are really annoying, they are tiny, fast and have a shell that makes ur damage look like a joke. \n\nAnother issue with combat Is, we can never tell when someone has died In this game, we have to just say on com's that one of us died. In BL2, there'd be an indicator on your screen with a sound when someone died so you always knew, but I find myself missing It all the time In this game. Also there's small things like I swear there's enemies with explosives on their backs that don't explode when you shoot them but that might be a nitpick, It just feels lame.\n\n[b][u]Inclusivity[/u][/b]\nSomething I do like about the game Is how It feels more inclusive, I thought the range of characters and voice actors of different identities and ideals was pretty neat. You can also pick from a set of pronouns for your character. \n\n[b][u]DLC[/u][/b]\nI'm not sure If the other games did this, but the DLC also feels shoehorned In a bit, like you're shown a class that you can't use, or worlds you COULD access with the DLC even though you don't have It, and are just told to go to the store. Looking at the reviews for the DLC, I'm assuming that's not a good Idea.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nI'm probably forgetting some things I want to say right now, but It just boils down to feeling boring, boxed In and unsatisfying. You can't get immersed Into this world, It feels stringed together and like nothing connects. The concept It great and I LOVE the worlds and stuff they have In here, they could have make something Incredible here but It just fell a bit short, especially If you're comparing It to the other games In the franchise.\n\nThis game Is not worth the curiosity, even If you're a fantasy fan. The game Is WAY too expensive, even on half price It's around £30, which Is In the high price range for me and my friends, I can't even imagine having paid In full for this. I can't justify It even at the half-way mark, It sucks, now I feel guilty for getting all my friends to spend so much on It, and I'm feeling forced to keep playing It just to feel like I got my.. or \"our\" moneys worth. I dread having to play It, and can't wait for It to end.",

            "review": "The (base) game is not worth the 60€ price tag and probably not even the 30€ that I got it at. Skyrim with My Little Pony mod installed feels more Borderlands than this.\n\nThe story of the game follows the familiar Borderlands format, with two caveats: there's basically no NPCs that follow you through the story, which is incredibly short. Sure, Tiny Tina and the Bad Guy narrate your adventures, but you're not regularly interacting with any recurring NPCs and there's very few familiar faces scattered about. For example, I would've expected Roland and Mr. Torgue to play significant parts in the game, what with their relationships with Tina. NPCs, in general, are entirely forgettable, with some minor exceptions.\n\nWhile the overworld map that connects all of the different zones is a neat idea and I like the various items scattered across it, I feel that it is very lacking in execution and is thoroughly undermined by the fast travel system. Either the overworld or the fast travel system should not exist. Additionally, the approximately four or five maps that are there for the so-called combat/random encounters in the overworld get incredibly boring, incredibly fast. \n\nSpeaking of maps, they are all very generic fantasy natural-scenery maps: there's a bit of grasslands, woods, city, sea floor and pirate beach. These are all fine and dandy, but the variety is significantly lacking in comparison to prior Borderlands titles. There's no volcano or underground biomes, for example, and what maps are there are very unimpressive visually.\n\nThe maps feature four primary factions: skeletons, greenskins, fungi and coiled (naga). None of the four factions have distinct mechanics or gameplay elements; there's nothing along the lines of skeletaurs, goliaths or hyperion bots at least before whatever is the equivalent of TVHM in this game. Technically, there's also pirates and bandits, but these are barely even visually distinct from skeletons, let alone mechanically. Scattered between the forces of the main factions are some fantastical beasts, such as wyverns and dogfish, which do distinguish themselves from one another.\n\nWith the fantasy theme come spells, which replace grenades and come with an automatic recharge mechanic. While some spells are incredibly powerful and feel great to activate as they can destroy an entire wave of enemies and put a huge dent even into badasses, most spells are lackluster and usually worse than firing a gun. The variety of spells is pretty good, but I wish that anything besides fissures actually had any \"oomph\" at all. For example, meteors come with a significant cast delay and have _tiny_ impact areas by comparison and absurd recharge times to boot.\n\nAlongside spells there are the class-based skills. There are exactly three interesting skills: polymorph, invisibility and reaper of bones, though ambi-hextrous deserves an honorable mention for conceding that the spells are strictly more interesting than the action skills. Everything else is of the format \"press button to deal damage\", which is confusing at best considering how easily many of the action skills in Borderlands titles could have been reskinned with a fantasy theme. \n\nSkill modifiers also do not exist, which combined with the above leads to every class feeling basically the same despite having extremely distinct themes. Your choices are to either shoot at stuff or hit them with your sword/axe/mace. None of the skill trees feel like a substantial change to how I play the game.\n\nAs there is only a single skill tree for every class, an opportunity to \"multiclass\" is presented. This essentially means slapping on the passives from another class to your initially chosen class. Don't forget to google the skill trees before you lock in, because the game does not actually give you any indication as to what the choice entails beyond a \"this class is good at fire damage\" when choosing and I don't know whether it is even possible to choose again. Nor do I really care, because why would I when there is essentially no difference?\n\nYou can freely choose your character's body shape, pronoun and voice independent of one another, which is nice, I guess, if I cared about any of that and if all of them weren't so incredibly bland. I have always enjoyed the various quips, puns and dialogue of the Borderlands player characters, but that does not materialize here.\n\nAll characters look essentially the same and outfits — the visually most distinctive part of your character — are tied to your class mod. There seems to only be a small handful of variants, all of which look the same. If you thought you could be a robot-ninja-pirate, think again. The color/pattern alterations you can make to your outfit are also incredibly bland and require you to find them as drops from enemies or from collectibles scattered around the world. If you thought Borderlands 3 had bad customization options with the ugly-ass head and body options, you really don't want to see what Wonderlands has to offer.\n\nTL;DR: it's bland. Buying and playing the DLC again is a better use of your time and money.",

That's plenty of game and honestly it got a bit samey after a while anyway. After about halfway through you've pretty much seen all the enemy types in the game so the combat can get repetitive. That said it is also very fun if you're just after more Borderlands. The inclusion of spells is a nice change from grenades for the franchise, though I'll admit I pretty much used only 1 or 2 different spell types because having to hold down a button for several seconds looking at the point you want to cast a spell leaves you a vulnerable so got annoying. Good variety of classes and more interesting perk upgrades than usual.\n\nNow the bad stuff. The game is way too easy. I rarely died and if I did it was because I missed a jump or accidentally bashed an exploding barrel thinking it was a regular one. Most boss fights were over within a matter of seconds with no strategy needed to defeat them. Ammo crates are spammed every 5 metres you walk so you never run out of ammo and have to change weapon so you only do so when you get bored. The UI is pretty poor. For example, to put a way point down on the map you think it would make sense that you could just click on the map where your mouse cursor is right? Well apparently not, because you have to drag your mouse across the screen to move the map cursor to the point on the map you want the way point to be. It's really awkward. Also the characters in the game apart from Tiny Tina are really lame and annoying. Not quite as bad as in BL3 but not far off. It was cringe inducing stuff.\n\nThere's a good game to be had, but the incessant chatter from cringey dialogue and laughably easy combat makes it easy to forget that the core gun play is the only thing holding this game together.",

I missed this when it came out and didn't read any reviews because it's borderlands. The game is beautiful, the cross with D&D is fun, the over world I thought was a nice edition. I was taking my time doing lots of side quest and such and beat the game on accident. They put a lot of effort into the game so I can't understand why you wouldn't write a better story. Sad. If this was a ten dollar game sure, but full price for the rubbish story is a big disappointment. They want you to buy all this DLC when the game is shallow is a slap in the face. Shame.",

You'll fight through the same combat arenas over and over again whilst clearing out bandit camps and dungeons etc.\n-There's a solid range in weapons and magic, but again, over time this will become repetitive and you'll genuinely find yourself getting bored. \n\n[b][u]STORY (2/10)[/u]\n-The story seems like it's tailored for an audience of five year old's or teens with the sense of humour of a toddler. For me, it didn't really draw me in that much as the boss fights were lackluster along with the rest of the combat. Nothing felt really special. \n-There's an abundance of left-wing wokeness in this game. You have trans/gay pirates, pronouns, gender-neutral terminology, so on so forth. I don't play a game to be surrounded by political propaganda.\n\n[b][u]THE OPEN WORLD/EXPLORATION (6/10)[/u]\n-The Overworld is poorly designed and looks terrible. 'Nuff said. \n-The area's you'll go into all unique in their own way, and host a lot of side-quests (which I'll touch on later in this review), which is somewhat of a good thing. \n-These unique areas can be quite large and repetitive however, so you'll find yourself getting bored after only a few hours of playing. \n\n[b][u]SIDE-QUESTS (3/10)[/u]\n-The side quests feel the same as the main story - very plain and boring. \"Go from A to B to collect or kill XYZ\". You'll fight against the same enemies spouting the same two voice lines they have over and over again. Very boring and tedious. \n\n[b][u]ACHIEVEMENTS (6/10)[/u]\n-I've been unlocking a few achievements just by playing through the main story and the side quests, but I've taken the time to look at the rest of the achievements for 100% completion. If you look at my profile you'll realise that I'm a fan of 100% games, but I don't think I'll be able to bring myself to do it for this one. The niche achievements look very boring and way too grind-filled. At this time I'm not planning on completing this game with all achievements, but if that changes I'll be sure to update this review. \n\n[b][u]VOICE ACTING (8/10[/u]\n-The voice acting in this game was good, done by some familiar names such as Andy Samberg. At the end of the day you can't blame the cast for bad writing. They did their job well for this game and how bad the writing was. Hats off to them. \n-You can see the full cast here https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14831458/\n\n[b][u]SUMMARY/OVERALL SCORE = 4.8/10[/u]\n-I purchased this game at 33% off and would not recommend anyone to buy it at full price. The game was enjoyable for the first few hours, but after that everything this game provided became repetitive, and the cringe writing became unbearable. The voice acting was good, and the weapons/spells were mostly enjoyable, but everything else about this game is just plain boring. \n",

The story is ok with a lot of the humour that you would expect and some old favorites (or hated chars...hehe) returning for some banter along a board game, its not a bad move since this has been done in BL 2 with great success. However, it is quite shallow and since it is a board game it does not really engage me in the story, but it was ok, nothing special at all but ok.\n\nGunplay is great as usual, builds are fun to explore etc. But.... the DLCs are so bad I do not even have words for it, next time just add more items in the game with the patch and skip the teedious quests that takes away the tempo of the game and offers zero in interesting lore. The DLCs are pure shir, sorry for the language. They are all annoying to do compared to BL content overall and there is ZERO story or rewards to care about apart from some new items. \n\nLate game farm is not terrible. I will for sure spend more time doing more builds etc. But keeping track of gear in the stash with no possibility to word search etc. is a bit of a joke by now. Having multiple chars with one bank with sortiing and scrolling being the only options for overview is beyond bad. Lots of bugs still but that does not matter for me, yet, since none are game breaking. \n\nA really good game overall for new players (i think, if they only want to go through it and maybe spend a few hours more after last boss) but for BL standards I give it 6/10 since it could have been so much better.",

            "review": "When I started playing this game, all of its problems drove me nuts.  (Most of the negative comments and issues described in the other reviews are accurate.)  But nevertheless, after a while I was hooked.  The setting is appropriately grimdark, the music is great, the combat is a lot of fun, and although there are only a few classes there is a lot of customization available to keep things interesting.  The dialogue is inane, but this is Warhammer; what else would you expect?  Some of the voice acting is hideously awful though.  It sounds like one of the devs recruited their middle-school kids to do it between dinner and homework.  The main story and sidequests are engaging, and the random missions are fun for multiple replays.  Co-op is available, and has an auto-leveling feature.  PvP is supposedly available, but I never have tried it.  There are co-op and PvP lobbies available, and joinable \"cabals\", but these features appear to be pretty dead at present.  The devs made a serious effort to overhaul the game after its initial mediocre reviews, but it's pretty clear that they've moved on so not much more will happen with the game. \n\nIf you like \"Grim Dawn\" or \"Torchlight 2\" you will probably like this game.  I really can't speak for Diablo fans because I didn't like it, but it's the same general concept so if you liked Diablo there's a good chance it will interest you.  Also, if you like the Warhammer 40,000 universe, it captures that atmosphere and should appeal to you on that level.  It has a lot of problems that the other reviews describe in detail, so you should definitely wait for a Steam sale.  (And although I don't have the \"Sororitas\" DLC, it is clearly not worth full price because there is no additional content, aside from the class itself.)  The Emperor Protects!\n\nEDIT: I should add that a really fun feature is the destructibility of various objects and terrain features.  Eldar shooting at you from behind barrels?  Blast the barrels out of the way!  Tyrannids under a pillar?  Bring it down on top of them!  Just in a bad mood and got a big gun? Destroy everything you can!  Also, the smaller terrain features often have rewards when destroyed.  Usually it's only a bit of money, but sometimes you can find  health, supplies or equipment.  Long Live The Imperium!",

            "review": "A quick overview of the game's post-release evolution. When this game released, it felt very sluggish  - moving, engaging, looting all felt slow. The devs did a massive overhaul of combat, increasing movement speed, combat moves and cooldowns, and there are simple loot filter and auto-pickup options (neither of which need to be enabled. They are off by default). This level of attention after the release of the game, when other devs might have moved on, is remarkable to me. They took a game that was Not Bad and made it into something very memorable to me.\n\nAfter that overhaul, seasons with unique season mechanics began. These have unique mechanics that cause enemies and/or anomalies to appear in normal missions and interacting with these give you progress toward season-specific boss missions. The season will also have a new type of affix that can now appear on weapons (such as one affix that allows you to release lightning on hit or being hit while other affixes combine to make it chain longer or do more damage, etc). There are also the equivalent of runewords (psalm-code doctrines) and the components can be removed at any time and leave both the item and components intact for use in other gear.\n\nThe sound is good, especially the fighting sounds of guns, melee, fire, explosions and more. There's nothing like jump packing into a mob that explodes as you use a las cannon or flamer to melt the survivors. The story is fine though nothing to write home about. Leveling is steady even at higher levels, making the tarot cards that give extra XP feel like viable options.\n\nThere are a couple options for endgame. You can continue regular missions (of which there are 10 types) that you can do to earn gear and reputation in the respective systems (of which there are 20). Acquiring reputation unlocks additional systems and, more importantly, tarot cards. Tarot cards are the difficulty + reward multipliers for any endgame map. A card will specify the type of negative and positive it will give you - I.E. melee enemies get a random damage or defensive buff but you have a chance to double the end-of-mission rewards. Some tarot cards also raise the area level until it is many above your own, allowing the game to continue scaling after level 100.\n\nThere are also random intel missions which are short quest chains with a reward at the end and it provides you 2-3 mission types to choose from at each step.\n\nThe main endgame option is Void Crusades. There are 9 different ones, each with its own static map creating a web that connects the nodes. You can path through the web differently depending on if you want the maximum reward chests at the end or if you want to save the nodes that raise the difficulty of all remaining levels so that you have an easier run overall.\n\nI haven't touched on many things like the solid crafting/rerolling system (you can modify all but one class of item as many times as you want) or character classes (3 base classes with 3 specializations each in Inquisitor, the WH40K:Inquisitor - Prophecy stand-alone game has another campaign and character with it that can also be used in this game, and the Sororitas DLC that came out recently is a 5th class (class only, no new campaign/missions).\n\nI've played this game on and off for years. I never bought into the random negativity in the discussion board. I just get on for a few weeks at a time and have fun purging heretics, xenos, and daemons.",

            "review": "I unfortunately ultimately can't recommend the game, even though it has a lot going for it. Leveling up, going through the campaign, playing all of the classes, are all fun to do. I love the Warhammer 40k setting, but the game really falls apart at endgame.\n\nTo put it into perspective, this is the first season I participated in and the first time I fully completed the campaign. After putting in 160 hrs into this season, I still haven't had the one piece of armour with the enchant I need on it to finish my basic build. The make matters worse, it is of a rarity type that you aren't able to reroll the enchant in hopes of getting to one you need. The chances of finding a specific type of armour with the exact enchant you need is astronomical. \n\n  I also have not yet been able to complete the last seasonal goal of upgrading a tarot card to level 3. The reason for this is that if you upgrade your tarot cards when you can, as a player would naturally do, you have just added weeks, months, or even years to your grind without knowing it. The only way you can avoid that is to stumble upon a new player tips guide or forum post somewhere before you make that mistake. It also means that when I unlock a new type of tarot card from gaining reputation in a star system, I'm not happy about it, but get angry because they just instantly added another week to the grind. I ended up adding weeks of extra RNG to my tarot card upgrading before I found out how the system works. \n\nI can say I will not participate in endgame again, as the amount of RNG and grind is unreal. It rivals any mobile game, but in mobile games at least people have the option to pay to speed up their progress and not spend months or years grinding it out. Whoever runs the maths on this stuff is so out of touch with reality.",

Captures the grim dark from the far future like few others were able to. \nThe story was well thought and the variety of warhammer assents are pretty solid. \nNeocore has done a nice job in keeping the support , with seasons, events, etc.\nMy sole complaint is that i cant use the techpriest from their \"standalone\" expansion on the martyr quest story.\nOther than that, its a pretty compelling ARPG.\n",

Playing Hi-Fi RUSH felt like re-playing a timeless classic such as Okami HD, Super Mario 64 or Psychonauts, but made for the modern era. The whole time playing felt like I was watching an interactive comic turned into anime. Before I started to play Hi-Fi RUSH, being a rhythm game I thought only combat would be on a beat, but I was wrong because when I actually started to play it I realised that the ENTIRE WORLD INTERACTIONS ARE SYNCHRONISED TO MUSIC! Mind blowing concept! Gameplay is smooth, art style is fantastic, the soundtrack is awesome & the challenge is superb! My last note is that I did not encounter a single bug or a crash which is a surprise because in the past decade or so, every newly released game was unplayable & some companies took years to fix their products, but not this game. It's truly a flawless masterpiece and I can't praise it enough. Well done Tango Gameworks and Bethesda Softworks, because you made a game that I will fondly remember for ages!",

It have ten licensed music tracks throughout the story and all of them fits perfect to where you at in the game right now and the boss fights. I can guarantee you 100$ or more that you will jam to one of these soundtracks FOR SURE. The [b]Gameplay[/b] is rhythm-based where you will need to perfect time hit a button to perform QTE or just the combat of this game and i appreciate that in this game it is not necessary to perfect time every hit thanks to the design of the rhythmic traits ( except few must needed parts which are pretty easy ). Even in order to help you find your rhythm, the whole world of Hi-Fi Rush pulses with the beat of whatever music is currently playing, providing you with both visual and audio cues for nailing its timing.You get different skills / combat moves as you progress through the game and they are easy to learn through good tutorial for each of them. The [b]Story[/b] of Hi-Fi rush is also very well written and keeps you entertain throughout the time you spend on it. It starts off with [spoiler] [b]Chai[/b], a 25-year old man with a disabled right arm and a dream to become a rockstar, arrives at the Vandelay Technologies campus to volunteer for Project Armstrong, a test program for cybernetic limb replacement. Unbeknownst to Chai, the CEO, Kale Vandelay secretly designates Chai to be a garbage collector for the company’s waste management [/spoiler] and how you go on from there ( pacing ) is well done IMO. It is a straightforward story BUT there are fun twist and turns throughout it. Other than that the [b]Boss fights[/b] were super fun to beat and the characters are REALLY REALLY well written, fun to hang around with, to learn about them and [b]Chai, the main hero of this game [/b] is super well voice acted, funny and just you just get to love him in this game. The game looks visually stunning to look at. Performance is also super well optimized with me having 60fps throughout it and you can get above that also with powerful GPU\n\n[b]OVERALL, Hi-Fi Rush Shadow-dropping tactic by [u]Tango Gameworks[/u] was a very brilliant and smart move and this game is a MUST-PLAY if you are into listening / jamming to good soundtrack and rhythm-based games, Worth all the price of it ( or play it on Gamepass which makes is 2 times worth it )[/b]\n\n[h2]Game Link:[/h2]\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/\n\n[url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/hi-fi-rush] Hi-Fi Rush on GamePass [/url]",

This game is outstanding and deserves even more love than it gets already!\n\nFrom the devs that made... *checks notes* THE EVIL WITHIN?!? Daaaaaaaaamn their comedy and art direction in this is S-Tier! The game plays like an old Gamecube/PS2/OG-Xbox era action platformer, with rhythm attributes in the mix. You can tell that a lot of love went into this game, from the stage design, combat feel, to the voice acting. This game has charm in spades and then some, and runs really well too!\n\nI've only rarely encountered minor stuttering, but it's not enough to detract from the experience. It's only really happened to me when I was in a traversal segment and there's not much going on anyhow. Other than that, it's been completely bug-free so far.\n\nAlso, one of the big bads is a reference to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and the weeb in me squeals with delight. I also love the nods to The Evil Within with some robo-ified Sebastian and Joseph cameos.\n\nThis game honestly deserves your money even at full price. The amount of detail and love put into this game is insane and exactly what the industry needs in this day and age!",

            "review": "TLDR down below.\n\nBest shooter roguelike out there.\n\nHas everything a modern roguelike should have: \n\n- Multiple characters that feel unique:\n Every character has multiple styles of play. You can focus on one of their 2 special abilities or on abilities that improve your weapons. But this is not required, you can use a bit of all 3 styles and still feel strong. Most characters gravitate to certain kinds of weapons with which they will probably do best. All characters have 3 trees of 6 power ups that you can pick from after you finish a stage.\n\n- a lot of different weapons to get:\nThere are over 50 weapons divided into 8 classes. Most weapons feel unique and have their own gimmick. You can carry up to 2 weapons making certain combo's is possible. A downside with such a big selection is of course that some weapons feel like weaker versions of others. Also each weapon being pretty unique means that some will not be suited to your style at all. \n\n- Permanent upgrades:\nThere is permanent progression between runs you can upgrade with a currency you get by playing. I know this goes against the definition of roguelike but all modern rogues have this feature. The devs can make harder/more fun encounters that feel unfair but get less unfair the more you invest in this system which ultimately makes the game better since they can push the boundaries the game. You can also go for an extra challenge by not/ partially investing in this to make it harder for yourself.\n\n- Difficulty settings:\n\nThere are 4 difficulties to play in. You are locked to normal at the start but unlock higher difficulties by beating the hardest difficulty you currently have. The 4th difficulty is the most unique, it features unique upgrades you can buy with the same currency used for the permanent upgrades (this means that currency is not useless when you unlocked the whole prema upgrades tree which is nice) which will change the way you play in a major way and is so much fun! The game never feels to unfair, you can win the game with any combination of weapons/power ups as long as you can keep dodging!\n\n- Many upgrades\nDuring the run you encounter these power ups called occult scrolls, they can straight up boost your damage/survivability or change the way you play. Some boost you in a big way but will also restrict you in a way, there is a lot of different 'builds' you can aim to go for.\n\n- 4 worlds to go through, with their own enemies to fight.\nThe enemies are cool, there is ranged and melee enemies. Some have unique mechanics that are not super hard to play around. Of course this gets harder when it's accompanied by other enemies. Enemies get harder in the later worlds, it's not uncommon to almost get oneshot there. The bosses of these areas are also very good. Huge monsters in their own arena with alot of different attacks that have to be dealt with, and somewhere in between you are supposed to actually kill them.\n\n- Active devs\nThe game still gets regular patches and updates, there is still a roadmap for their future content like in the beta. They have added new characters, bosses, a new world and a new game mode since beta. There is still more to come as well. When you encounter bugs in game there is a feedback option which you can access during your run and explain the bug. And you actually get listened to, every bug I have reported over the years has been fixed in a reasonable time frame, almost always in the next patch.\n\n- Good pricing\nThis game is 100% worth getting at full price. It is more then reasonable if you see the huge amount of content here that puts AAA games to shame. There has been 1 DLC so far which included 2 characters. So far it is the only content that is gated behind a DLC, their new game mode that could have been a DLC in itself was added completely free. If you are looking for a game like this I would just buy it now!\n\n- Multiplayer\nThe game supports multiplayer, there is a matchmaker to play with random people as well. I cannot comment on the quality of that since I never did that. I have only played multi with 1 friend and it was fun, every player gets their own weapon and scroll drops so nobody can 'steal' your upgrades like in Risk of Rain 2. If you don't need your drops you can press a button to make them visible for your allies so they can pick it up. You can help each other get to their preffered build faster but you can't get 'griefed' by people that steal your drops. I feel this is the best way to create a multiplayer experience in a co-op game. The new game mode can also be played with friends. \n\nTLDR:\nif you like this genre, you should definitely buy this. Big worlds, al lot of characters, weapons and power ups. Different difficulties for everyone, a multiplayer that is done extremely well for a co-op game. The devs should feel very proud of what they accomplished with this game. I look forward to the bright future of this game!\n\nThe game has this big \"one more run\" feel that every good roguelike should have.\n\nIf I have to put a number on it it's a 9,5/10 for me. I hope this review helped any people with doubts to make a good decision!",

            "review": "Meh, I want to like this game more but it's got a lot of problems for me personally. It's not bad, I enjoy it and play it with friends or on my own occasionally but everytime I do nowadays I just end up irked over one thing or another. I could probably recommend it if you like this sort of thing, but I'd like to list out my problems as someone that's played both a lot of shooters and roguelikes/lites.\n\nAlthough I'll start with the good, the gunplay and weapon designs are incredible and a ton of fun to mess with, reincarnation is incredible too, the wacky builds you can pull off at that point are a ton of fun. That's really the main positive here, and if that's good enough for you you'll probably love this. It's great for more casual play.\n\nThe problems start with the enemies, its not necessarily their attack patterns, their hp, or anything like that. They're well balanced, but for a few reasons they don't *feel* satisfying to fight. The way they move around is kind of awkward, rigid, and janky, its not smooth at all and feels random and just frustrating enough to lower the feel of combat for me. Its not bullshit or anything, but it makes it harder to enjoy the great gunplay and with enough playtime it became harder and harder for me to overlook.\n\nThe game has a lot of content, side modes and such that might seem like nice mixups at first but it all ends up being kinda mediocre and I just end up playing reincarnation instead. Spirtual Assault is still a complete mess, its not a bullet sponge hell-hole anymore but its just soooo boring and really highlights the unsatisfying enemy design. It needs to seriously be cut down and better paced, it goes on way too long for how mindless and spammy it is. The final boss for it is designed okay move-wise but is still annoyingly tanky and unfun to fight as a result.\n\nThe further you go into the game progression wise the more of a problem the stat system becomes.  It's much better to stick with one weapon early on with good affixes and pump all the money into it. Unless you're playing a character like the dog there's little reason to ever switch between two weapons, ammo is plenty and its way too costly to invest into two weapons when you can just funnel everything into one broken one. \n\nThis isn't inherently a problem necessarily but then it leads to runs becoming samey, you're just waiting until you get an OP combination and then just spamming that weapon at enemies, it leaves the combat loop lacking depth, the only skill thats really rewarded as a result is the ability to dodge enemies. There's no major tactics here, most characters except like, the monkey, have a clearly defined weapon type/s they're good with, so thats what you go for. \n\nYou want shotguns/melee, you play the bird, you want smgs/assault rfiles play the bunny, fire weapons? the fox. I wish the characters were more open-ended in their design, would be much more interesting for builds.\n\nOverall its not a bad game, just a shallow one. Don't go into this one expecting any major complexity or depth. You shoot the bad guys, dodge occasionally, and build around whatever rng has given you. It's a passable way to spend the time, but there's both roguelites and shooters out there that offer way more depth and engaging gameplay than this if thats what you're looking for.",

I reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of roguelite games, you will have countless hours of fun. I forgot to mention they just came out with their 2nd dlc and both dlc are priced under $10. This game is always being updated and its still so much fun. \n\nyeet",

I will never buy another 2k product, I will pirate the game, and I will use cheat engines and everything they don't want us to use that costs them money out of their greedy a** pockets. We get old gen games at new gen prices, they treat the honest players like trash, they can't do anything to combat the cheaters, and they care only about money, not their product.

Without directly naming anyone, I expressed my frustration regarding cheaters in a discussion forum and my message was swiftly deleted. The moderator expressed that even though I did not call anyone by name, I am not allowed to insult cheating behaviour in general. I was also asked to add citations to my message which I think it not necessary in a gaming forum. Not only do players themselves have to report cheaters one by one with extensive video footage, we are also not allowed to name call the very cheaters who (for years) have been disrupting our days/game-play everyday. I have also invested a considerable amount of time and money in the My Team game mode and cheaters are able to quit the game when they are losing and the score will not count. This is unacceptable and not professional behaviour by both the cheaters and the management. This seriously needs to be investigated.\n\n(If any cheater reading this is having an existential crisis and is deeply offended by my review, I simply don't give a damn. I will be in Ante Up if you want to vs me but you don't have to bring your balls because we all know you don't have any.)",

As expected the core gameplay has been worked on to perfection for years now so players know what will be brought to the table - just an overall smooth and crushingly-detailed basketball simulator. This isn't the first time Micheal Jordan has graced the cover of a 2K sports game, but a lot of time has passed since then and things have changed for the good and for the bad.\n\nIf you look to play this, you have to consider many things: do you care about the you-against-the-AI aspect of it all or do you really crave that online player-vs-player feel. If your heart lies somewhere in the middle, you have to choose a side here because there's no in-between. Playing online-only means that you will have two years at max before the servers are shut down intentionally, forcing you to pay top dollar for the inevitable next installment. Playing against the AI means 2K can't do s**t to you if you want to stay in 2K23, having fun at the various modes it has to offer - NBA 2K23 will be playable even after the specific game has been deleted from the store. So choose carefully... when it's on sale (don't feed the pigs even more).\n\nOn PC, this game is fun to play against the AI - no bugs, no glitches and an overall satisfied experience playing completely alone. Do I recommend NBA 2K23? Yes, if you play against the AI, If you aim to play online - please read the other reviews of players who've had an even greater experience than me there. It's a lot to unpack there, for sure.\n\nFollow your heart.",

But you'd enjoy one of the older games, especially the 2k14 one which is, imo, the best one on steam. \n\nAlso for no reason at all this game is 123GB large and it uses the last generation engine. Why is it so large, I have no idea when there are games that offer 6x the content as this and are only 50gbs.

I dont have any NBA game,so I bought it and I'm not regret. There are a lot of negative reviews, I'm just playing MyTeam and I will just play MyTeam so I didnt see anything that bad. I almost forgot,there is no 144hz in game. How ?. In 2023 %85 of the players has 144hz or 144+hz monitors.It's not that big deal but If I have this specs,I want to use it. CPU sometimes can do odd movements like Cedi Osman posterized my Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I read too many review people wrote about game crash and bugs.At auction house, just for once, my game just crashed. If you don't have any nba game and you just want to play MyTeam and versus to your friends,you can buy.\n\n\n[b] WARNING : IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MYPARK OR MYCAREER AND YOU ARE BUYING FOR THIS PURPOSE YOU SHOULD KNOW,THIS GAME HAS NO ANTI-CHEAT !  [/b] \n\n[b] WARNING 2 : IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY CONTROLLER DEVICE, DONT BUY THIS GAME. AT THE ENTERANCE GAME GIVING ADVICE ABOUT THIS MATTER.  [/b]",

First you will have to play 2 entire 82 game seasons without skipping  to get you character to 90 without spending additional money. During those games you hope the game doesn't bug out while your on the bench and doesn't allow you to skip. Yes an Alt Tab x3 will fix this but why do i have to do that to play? The AI never does anything. Call a play and they do anything but that. The games store page works flawless though if you want to buy VC. Do better 2k.",

It`s some \"NAT\" problem (which from what I`ve seen is comon for this game) so  when I try to host a game it doesn`t work and displays this \"NAT\" eror. I tried all the ways possible to fix it and none of the ones I found worked. But it gets even worse, cause the day before I wanted to buy DLCs everything was just fine, I hosted a lobby and everything worked perfect, and nothing has changed since that day. And we don`t really want to play standart UNO, and since I can`t host a game and my friends don`t have DLCs or want to buy one, we just don`t play it. If they at least added feature allowing host of the lobby launching DLCs other players in lobby have, I wouldn`t complain, but there isn`t one so this game is just waste of money.",

The added benefit of this is when your friend finishes the game on a draw 4 card for the second time that night you can punch them instead of your monitor.",

I find the gameplay frequently frustrating, especially in how you can know exactly what you need to do but the camera angles and controls get in the way, so you have to repeat things not because of challenge but because of a lack of precision. I don't think the characters make much sense, nor does the story add up, relying on grimdark twists instead. But in spite of all of this, the artistry on show in the series remains excellent. I can't think of many video game worlds that feel this tactile. And even if the whole is less than the sum of its parts, the individual parts are of a dark beauty that is unparalleled. If you can accept the gameplay being so-so and the story not being all that coherent, and if you like the game's aesthetic, do check it out.",

            "review": "I played and finished the first game and enjoyed it and wanted to get the sequel. Overall, the best parts of the game were the graphics, atmosphere and music/sound design. It lends itself to a creepy feeling, tense experience. Those were my favorite parts of both games. \n\nOn the flip side, probably due to the nature of the way the game is played as a 'side scroller', but also 3d, it can be extremely frustrating at times to control the character how one desires. For example, making jumps across and not knowing the depth of the field in terms of how far forward or back the character is, can be confusing. Also, picking up certain objects can be very annoying as the hit box sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. I got to the point where I dreaded any section where I had to use mechanics to get through. The frustration with the controls/mechanics ruined the immersion for me several times unfortunately. \n\nAs far as the story went, I felt like it was OK, but certainly left a ton to the imagination. I wouldn't have minded if there was something more direct in terms of narrative. It got me thinking about what a game like this would be like with a very direct story that presented information not telling the gamer what conclusion to draw, but at least presenting something more specific. \n\nAt this point, I am not sure if I would buy a third incantation of the game unless I saw some reviews that discussed how the game controls and mechanics were more smooth/usable. Ultimately I would recommend this game as long as someone doesn't mind being patient with some janky controls/mechanics and maybe has played the first game so one knows what's in store.",

The  music, the sounds, the environment, the story, the characters.\n\nWhen I was deciding to purchase the game I read the comments saying that the controls were clunky, and the 2.5D is weird and all, these things to me were not a problem. Although there is a chapter where they introduced a new macanique that is actually realy annoying to control, and you are required to use it with a certain level of precision that the controls just don't offer.\n\nI really enjoyed the game up until this specific chapter, during the chapter I wanted to rage and quit and thought the game was bad, and after that the game came back to being awsome. So I still recommend the game. Even if to me personally there was a polarizing point in the game were you need to master a IMO badly implemented mechanic.\n\nSo buy it, enjoy in, but brace yourself for chapter 3.",

They think they introduce a complicated situation by uncovering the relation between the main protagonist and antagonist but in reality it does not make sense.",

Whether through anger at losing a fight in the last phase, or heart racing exhilaration at beating the hell out of a giant bird! Library of Ruina is a game that is masterful at setting the mood for many parts of the game. Whether this is due to how the music changes depending on whether or not you are doing well, or how the boss just pulls out their own anime move that makes you go, oh my god i am dead...\n\nI would like to say Project Moon really knows how to make a world feel so colorful and full of despair and pain, but also filled with a bit of hope that even through all the pain, you can get back up again and be happy.",

It’s not just me as I play with others and they too get the same joys as me. \nWe will but running through a town and open a door or jump out a window or fence and low and behold we sit there falling through the map and at no prevail just falling and falling and falling. Does not correct itself at all and you have to log out. \nWhat really sucks when this happens is when you get smacked by a zombie you get sent to the underworld and just fall legs dangling forever getting your butt handed to you but unable to defend yourself and die. Only way to correct this is logging out and back in which if you are getting beat by a zombie or two don’t think you are coming back among the living with that character, that character has joined the zombies and and one with them and you get a fresh new character. \nFix that issue and this map/game would be amazing. Game has so much potential to be an amazing game!",

            "review": "[h1]If Spore grew up into a shallow, space-themed, open-world sandbox, with MMO-like grind[/h1]\n\nIf you have had the pleasure of playing Maxis' 2008 hit game, Spore - this game is the spiritual successor. Everything from trying to fly your spaceship to the center of the galaxy, exploring randomly generated worlds and ecosystems, to the casual combat feel. \n\n[u]The problem is, the universe of No Man's Sky is very shallow and repetitive, inspite of all its procedurally generation.[/u] What I mean by that, is that while the core gameplay loop (explore -> gather -> upgrade -> repeat) can be very enjoyable, [u]there is a lack of depth and variety in the gameplay.[/u]\n\nIf you are planning to get into this game, I hope you will go in with the expectations of a janky indy-project, more than a AAA blockbuster title or anything.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]Lack of Depth[/h1]\n\nLike Spore in the space stage, the gameplay is straightforward. First, you will learn how to survive in the environment, gathering resources to fix your spacesuit and tool. Then you are left to learn about the different ways of gathering resource / making money / fighting different enemies... and that's all there is to the game.\n\nDifferent worlds will have different hazards (cold/heat/radiation/acid/water) but these provides almost no difference in gameplay. You just get a different colored damage bar that you will have to refill with the same resource occasionally... Even the most basic of gameplay change, like having your laser gun overheat at different speed depending on the planet temperature, is not part of this game. Every planet also have the same gravity, every planet is a terrestrial world (no gas giants!?) and there is no exploration off-planets.\n\nYou will need to gather a variety of resources and recipes to make your life easier; but in the end, all you get is just a bigger number. No gameplay change, no interesting tradeoff in upgrades, just, finding gears with bigger number and more slots.\n\nThe alien interactions are also lacking. Though NMS tried to build a sense of mystery by having you learn the languages (literally word-by-word!), it is functionally meaningless. You can still trade and get along just fine without learning a single word.\nWhile some encounters may prompt you to read in the alien's language, getting the answer right provides meager rewards in the long run. You can get along just fine without them, and getting those rewards only help you minimally, mostly in the early game.\n\n[h1]Lack of Variety[/h1]\n\nThe game is extremely repetitive. You will see it, even on your first planet. \n\nEach world is just red/green/blue hills. The \"hazards\" are just different colored damage bars. Acid is green, heat is red, cold is blue, and radiation is yellow. All planets have the same gravity, just different size. No gas giants or any other interesting celestial bodies to explore. You can't even get out of your ship off-planet (and outside of space stations). Like, what do you mean I can't go and explore the asteroid belts? What do you mean I can't even fly into the sun if I wanted to!? \n\nThe different \"encounters\" are repeatedly copy-pasted over and over. Cargo drops? You'll find them everywhere. Crashed ship? Same shape, same cargo, same gameplay. Artifact digs? I hope you liked the toy where you dig dinosaur bones out of clay, because this is literally all you do. Not even the positions in each encounters are randomized. It's just land, go to the same location, do the same thing, lift off, and repeat.\n\nThe missions are also just cheaply randomized go here, do this, shoot that. Alien relationship means nothing, and you just spam \"learn dialect\" to get yet another word then walk away. Even Spore Galactic Adventures, a game from 2009, had more gameplay variety than this game.\n\nWhich brings me to the next issue...\n\n[h1]The Grind[/h1]\n\nThis game becomes all about grind. Go shoot that tree to get this resource, fly there and get that upgrade, repeatedly do capitalist things until you have enough money to buy a frigate that can carry all your stuff. Then go to the center of the galaxy I guess.\n\nI'm already sinking almost 40 hours into this game, and I've been repeatedly doing the same thing over and over and over... And I really want to recommend this game, but I just can't.\n\n[h1]The Jank[/h1]\n\nAnd to wrap all this up nicely, the game is very \"jank\".\n\n[u]The keyboard and mouse control scheme is probably the worst I have ever seen.[/u] It is very clear that this game was designed for controller first, and the keyboard and mouse controls were added later by someone who has never played on a PC. From the moment I booted up the game and got greeted with a \"hold left mouse to press button\", I knew I was in for a ride. Somehow, NMS devs has managed to make a control scheme that requires too many buttons, and also too deeply nested within its own submenus. I learnt the controls within about a day of playing, but the learning phase was absolutely infuriating.\n\nThe game is still also very buggy, [u]TEN YEARS[/u] after the game's 2013 VGX premiere. You will find generated cargo drops and plants floating / clipping into each other. The way procedural generation works is also very jank, as you will constantly find mountains and buildings fade in-out of existence while you are flying over a planet. Oh, and did I mention that your game will crash if you try to use its built-in screenshot function? Yeah, that's [i]still[/i] a thing.\n\n[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]\n\n> I love all the base-builder/sandbox games from Sim City to Minecraft, where I enjoy doing whatever the hell I pleased, without needing \"objectives\" to do. But No Man's Sky just doesn't have as much depth as those games.\n\n> I love all the grindy JRPGs where I repeatedly hit different colored slime with my bigger number sticks, where I eventually get to watch the story unfold. But No Man's Sky doesn't have as compelling a narrative like those games either.\n\n> I loved the original Spore for its carefree exploration of the universe.

I'll probably grind it just for completion, but nothing more. Spore did it better.",

I finally dove in a few months ago just to see if I would enjoy it. This is THE space survival game, no other game even comes close. If you're into survival games that is this is an absolute treasure. Not to mention the fact that they haven't done the whole Paradox thing and released 50 DLC at this point, all content has been free.\n\nMy ONE complaint, and it's probably just because I haven't spent enough time in the game. Is the whole \"Expedition\" mechanic. If you're familiar with Seasons from other big MMOs it's of the similar vein. I'm just not sure if \"I\" find them fun, doesn't mean that you wont of course.\n\nAs far as price goes, 60$ is a pretty steep cost. I personally try to buy everything on sale and rarely buy games at full price. The amount of content in this game though is easily more than your average two AAA combined, maybe even three.",

Nona is really fun for solo play but also as a more supportive character in multiplayer, too.\n\nLess positive on the weapons but they're pretty alright, the main stand out is the absurdity that is the brick, which manages to be very fun and powerful. Wolf Gaze and Star Ring are pretty decent, the star ring is a little weird but good for crowd control. Do not get the jet octopus's role at all though, its soooo sluggish, by the time I get it charged i probably could've killed the enemy already with any other weapon. It definitely needs tweaking imo.\n\nThe main gripe with this DLC is, and I feel bad for saying this, is the descriptions. It's always been a problem in the game that generally eventually gets fixed down the line, but my god it's at the worst here with Zi Xiao. I could not pick up on ANYTHING that he did until I found a handy guide that someone wrote. Important mechanics unmentioned or not properly described that are critical to playing the character right, and it just expects the player to somehow know.\n\nNormally the confusion stems from the issues that come with translation, but in this case its different. I feel like even in the original language, unless it was drastically rewritten, itd have the same problem of just... leaving critical information out. They need to rework how they relay this information to allow for more visual examples and showcasing passive or more intricate abilities if they're gonna be making these characters more complex and interesting like this. (Which is a good thing that they are!) It was a problem with Xing Zhe in the last dlc to a lesser extent too. I have to look on the wiki to know what each effect does, and if there is a way to see any of what i'm talking about, the game does not communicate it properly at all.\n\nI can definitely recommend this DLC if you're a fan of the basegame, regardless.",

            "review": "Young gamers who never played the original will likely love this remake. Some older gamers who have played and liked the original may hate this reboot because it's not a 100% exact copy. I happen to fall among the latter, and since the original Mafia is my favorite game ever and holds such a special place in my heart, it would make sense for me to be picky and b!tch about the reboot, how it misses some details, how things have changed and so on. But you know what? When I played Mafia: DE I was overrun by the same ecstatic emotions that I felt when I first played Mafia and I totally loved this new rendition.\n\nWhat else made this possible if not my nostalgia for the story, the city, the characters, etc.? But I didn't care - I loved it for what it was, loved to see the beauty of Lost Heaven backed by amazing visuals, loved to relive the story, loved the cars, the missions, pretty much everything. Yeah they could've worked on some characters a bit more, yeah they could've let us do some side jobs for Luca Bertone instead of simply using postcards for car missions, of course they could've let us play every part that was playable in the original instead of covering some bits with cutscenes, among a few other things. These are improvements that won't see the light of day, but I will never think that's enough to bash this game.\n\nThe game has been criticized for many reasons by the original's fans, from voice actors doing an allegedly crappy job to the gameplay being generic, and some gamers went so far as to immediately write Mafia: DE off because they saw Hangar13's name on it. I don't get it. Playing the remake I could often feel the love that the devs put into it, and not once did I think they were just doing their job making minimal effort. Mafia 1 was extraordinary in its details, it was a difficult yet rewarding game, and I suppose being so hardcore is why some of its fans can't get over the modernized remake. However, times have changed, the standards have changed, and I believe nowadays you often gotta appeal to a much wider audience than some 20 years ago if you want your game to succeed. And it probably just so happens that that audience is a tad more generic than it was in 2002.\n\nIn any case, I understand the criticism that this game got from some long-time fans of the franchise, and they definitely don't have to like Mafia: Definitive Edition. As for me, I didn't like it either. I loved it.\n",

I actually appreciate how they have expanded Sarah's story as it feels more complete now.\n\nBut I didn't feel connected with some other characters like the way I did in the original Mafia. It just hasn't been the same with Ralph, Lucas & even Vincenzo. Also, I love the original soundtracks way more.\n\nThis is still an amazing game though. \n\nP.S - The race in the classic mode is still as hard as I could recall. It took like 3 weeks for me & my brother to successfully complete that race (we took turns) when the original came out. Can never forget that! 🤣🤣\n\n",

The conversations in the game in Italian (if played in the original English language) are obscene :D\nIn order not to hire an Italian actor for the dubbing, they had an English native speaker read sentences who most likely didn't even know what he was reading: D Clearly English accent, wrong tonality, wrong pauses, in short, a disaster.\nAll this, however, gives even more charm to the whole, makes it even more vintage.",

If you are going for %100 of the achievements its not hard but not that easy, very time consuming as well if you dont use something like mapgenie, as pretty much everything stays unmarked. \n\nside missions are terrible and the only reason you should ever do them is to maybe unlock a car for the achievements\n\noverall 9/10 game",

            "review": "I was honestly quite skeptical of Watch Dogs 2 before I played it. I finally played the first Watch Dogs and found it really good, like, shockingly fun and engaging! And in the first two hours, I wasn't quite sold on Watch Dogs 2. But it clicked quickly after that and I had just as much fun with that game as I did with the first.\n\nWatch Dogs 2 is, in my eyes at least, a Jedi Academy-esque sequel in the sense it vastly improves on it's predecessor's gameplay with no (!) downsides. These improvements include:\n\n- noticeable smoother movement\n- better cover (the cover jank from the first game is GONE)\n- better driving\n- better radio controls with actual dedicated radio stations\n- better police (you can no longer escape even the highest wanted levels just by stepping on a boat)\n- different clothing stores and more clothing customization\n- improved graphics (Watch Dogs looks great, but Watch Dogs 2 has notably better reflections, character models and the indoor areas, Nudle campus being my favorite, are a highlight)\n- new gadgets that are actually really useful!\n- more gangs (though with less significance)\n- gang warfare and police gang fights, with great fun to be had with related hacking abilities\n- sailboats!!!!!\n- better and actually useful sightseeing\n- better car app\n- VASTLY expanded hacking\n\nand so on\n\nAll that while retaining the great sandbox levels the series is known for. Now, of course, there are a few small things that aren't improved. The finance system is improved from Watch Dogs, in particular, weapons are more expensive and hacking bank accounts nets way less money. But it still is kinda broken and before you know it, you're swimming in cash with not that many ways to spend it, in particular since your ammo still gets magically filled up around missions. Gunplay is slightly worse than Watch Dogs, didn't find it that notable though, and I REALLY liked the now-removed gang hideouts.\n\nBut overall, I was just amazed by how many improvements and additions the developers came up with. In the $911 mission, during the refinery section, I took out only the mandatory targets, snuck away undetected to the nearby pier and escaped via sailboat into the sun – that was PEAK Watch Dogs!\n\nAside from the gameplay, it get's less exciting. As for setting and style, it's at least cohesive, though in my personal taste, I prefer gloomy autunm Chicago any day of the week over sunny SF. Ubisoft Connect is also awful, but you know that already. The story?\n\nThe Story is, well, kinda bad. Part of this might be that I played the game in German. The german dub of WD1 is actually okay, I actually prefer german Aidan Pearce as the English dub is way to deep and raspy, perhaps further alienating players from him. The German version of WD2 is super cringe at times, in particular I cringed when they word-for-word translated things like \"insulting sb intelligence\" or \"plausible deniability\" - it just doesn't work! \n\nThat being said there still is some cringe, in particular when they use internet/nerd slang. It feels tacked on. The story has the overarching problem that it's clearly written in reaction to Aidan Pearce's unpopularity, undeserved in my opinion. Marcus and the crew are happy, colorful people with literally zero edges to them. They also take themselves way too seriously. A small revenge subplot falls flat almost immediately and another \"can I trust Ray?\" does too. A good character doesn't have to be likeable, he has to be interesting. I loved WD1's story because it was interesting, cohesive (WD1's world wasn't fun or colorful, it was dark, disgusting etc. and so was Pearce's mood), atmospheric and it was serious. \n\nThere is a real lack of cohesion and disconnect from this since as Marcus you will inevitably shoot and kill people whereas the other parts of the crew seem like peaceful college hacktivist kids. This isn't helped by the fact that the reputation system from WD1 was removed. This is porbably a good thing because it limited player freedom more than it was an interesting mechanic but it makes the disconnect even more apparent as Marcus can punch hoardes of civilians with zero impact. Marcus himself is a blank slate and until an audiolog right before the last mission, there is almost no background to him! Perhaps more importantly, the missions barely tie togehter. \n\nYes, WD1 does feel strechted quite a lot but every mission was connected to the ultimate goal of bringing Lena's murders to justice. In WD2, only a few missions tie in to the overarching \"defeat Blume\"-goal. In short: WD2' story is LACKING.\n\nOverall, still a clear A-tier game!",

            "review": "This game is pretty fun in all aspects involving the gameplay. The map is a blast to transverse, both by car and by foot because of its highly interactive world filled with cool things to mess with like the traffic lights, other cars or just bully random NPCs. The driving feels pretty good too, even though the cars might feel a little bit floaty. Also the gunplay is great, with pretty varied weapons which might feel a little bit too basic but when combined with the ability to hack the world and the gadgets available is pretty satisfying. And the side activities are pretty varied and fun too, ranging from invasions in other player’s worlds to kart racing. \n\nThe only cons is that the story extremely cringe and feels written by an amateur out of touch millennial writer who thinks that trends from 20-15 years ago still hold up, surprisingly the characters are pretty likable. And the missions might feel repetitive too, since they tend to be an infiltration in some random building, hack something there and leave, but there are some surprises.",

Then, it started randomly crashing due to memory leaks. Finally, it refused to run completely.\nNow, after a complete reinstallation it works again, but I've lost too much time and don't want to play anymore.",

            "review": "I recently purchased Watch Dogs 2 with high hopes, being a fan of the original game. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment within the first 10 minutes of gameplay. I encountered an overwhelming amount of bugs that made the game virtually unplayable. This is the first time I've ever uninstalled a game after such a short period of time.\n\nFrom the moment I started playing, it felt like the game was determined to frustrate me. Bodies were inexplicably flying through the air, and main character was performing strange sprint strafes.\n\nI had heard rumors about bugs plaguing the game after its release, but I couldn't fathom just how bad it would be. If my experience within the first few minutes is any indication, I can only imagine the nightmare players must have faced post-launch.\n\nWatch Dogs 2 had the potential to be a great sequel, but the abundance of bugs and glitches completely destroyed any enjoyment I could have had. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment by avoiding this game altogether. There are plenty of other titles out there that offer a polished and enjoyable experience, and Watch Dogs 2 simply doesn't belong among them.",

            "review": "Some red flags to consider when shopping for \"simulator\" titles like this: \n\n1. When you click on the developer's name it redirects to the entire PlayWay S.A. catalog. It's common practice with PlayWay to obfuscate what games a developer worked on before their current one, especially when the current one is likely to gain traction with content creators (like this one, which is going to sell itself on \"a 3D Papers, Please.\")\n\n2. Gunplay. Sim titles like this are a hodgepodge of mechanics and ideas, usually thrown together to pad for time. First-person shooter segments are never the strong point of a simulator title and this one leans into them quite frequently. Having spent a little time with it: the guns *could* be worse but they're in no way fluid or fun. Just bog-standard, and the only real UI to facilitate shooting is a weird red dot hovering over enemies, which feels like the result of a developer realizing all the earth tones in the map and character designs means you can't actually SEE the enemies that well. The solution: a cartoon dot that you just have to aim under to get headshots every time. \n\n3. Too many concepts. Contraband Police could be a solid game with just the border crossing and the idea of upgrading your outpost to be more effective. Gas Station Simulator showed you can have a really jankily-built game still have a sense of progression just by hiring AI and assigning them to do your least-favorite tasks. \n\nFrankly, I'd much rather not have to leave the outpost and partake of the lackluster driving sequences to travel to locations I don't particularly care for. Even the shootouts where the border post gets attacked could be interesting IF the whole point was I can upgrade my post to the point it's self-reliant. Sure, I can give my guys better guns and armor but at the end of the day, I still have to throw contraband and prisoners in a van and go run chores early-game. \n\nFrom reviews I'm seeing here, I know my dream of having a Gas Station Simulator-esque border crossing where I level up my NPCs to do menial tasks automatically (perhaps even add multiple inspection lanes and let an NPC do inspections for me with the understanding they have to flag me if any real inspection is needed) are not to be. The upgrades are purely to make things stronger when random attacks happen. \n\nIt's aggressively okay, but I worry I'll be back to this review in a few hours of gameplay with the same story most popular simulator titles have: after the first few hours they KNOW a streamer will broadcast, it drops off. Maybe it won't. For now: buy with caution.",

In my opinion, it can be tried on a discounts just for this sudden enjoyment.\n\nBut the game is starting to get extremely boring with little interaction and activities and repetitive days.\n\nThey tried to create a small world, and  it's a nice idea to take prisoners to camp or go somewhere to sell contraband, but it was a terrible way they implemented this. \nVehicle mechanics are absolutely terrible, such a mechanic like this should'nt exist in 2023. The roads are always the same and curvy becomes boring to drive after 2 minutes since you watch literally the same environment.\n\nOur main duty, the border guard, starts to repeat strangely after a point because we always do the same things and we don't have a proper target to improve. \n\nI really liked the details such as trying to interspersed with a story, murder solving, etc. It breaks the chain of being a border guard and feels like a change of atmosphere, but the story missions are too slow.\n\nRandom events that will fill every day can enrich the game. The only random event is getting ambushed by 4 raiders.  New interaction events that can be added will enrich the game. Increasing the typology of vehicle mechanics and roads/landscape and environment will positively affect the atmosphere.\nAt this point, you see that I played the game for 6 hours, and I played the last 1-2 hours by forcing myself. The final decision is up to you, I wrote down all the troubles I encountered here :)",

            "review": "Title: Contraband Police: A Promising Concept Hindered by Execution\n\nRating: ★★☆☆☆\n\nContraband Police, developed by Crazy Rocks Studios, is a game that aims to simulate the intense and dangerous world of border patrol and law enforcement. While the concept holds great potential, the execution falls short, resulting in a disappointing and lackluster gaming experience.\n\nThe game puts you in the role of a border patrol officer tasked with detecting and apprehending smugglers, uncovering contraband, and maintaining law and order. The premise is intriguing, and the idea of immersing players in the challenging and morally complex world of border control is commendable. However, the game's execution leaves much to be desired.\n\nOne of the major shortcomings of Contraband Police is its lackluster gameplay mechanics. The core gameplay loop revolves around stopping vehicles, inspecting them, and searching for hidden contraband. Unfortunately, the mechanics are clunky and often feel unintuitive. Interacting with objects and vehicles can be frustrating, with poor hit detection and imprecise controls hindering the overall experience. The limited variety of tasks and repetitive nature of the gameplay quickly become tedious, lacking the depth and variety needed to keep players engaged.\n\nAdditionally, the game suffers from a lack of polish and optimization. The graphics are subpar, with dated visuals that fail to create a visually appealing or immersive environment. The open-world setting feels barren and lifeless, lacking the vibrancy and attention to detail that could have made it more engaging. Furthermore, technical issues such as bugs, glitches, and occasional crashes further hinder the gameplay experience, detracting from any enjoyment that could be derived from the game.\n\nAnother significant letdown is the game's lack of compelling storytelling or meaningful progression. There is a lack of a cohesive narrative that could have provided context and purpose to the player's actions. The absence of a clear progression system or meaningful rewards diminishes any sense of accomplishment or motivation to continue playing.\n\nWhile Contraband Police attempts to create a realistic portrayal of law enforcement, it falls short in its implementation. The game fails to capture the complexity and moral dilemmas inherent in such a profession. The interactions with suspects and the decision-making process lack depth and fail to provide meaningful consequences for the player's choices.\n\nOn a positive note, the game does offer a multiplayer mode, allowing players to collaborate or compete with others in enforcing the law. This mode adds a slight layer of variety and can offer some enjoyment when playing with friends. However, it does little to salvage the overall shortcomings of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Contraband Police falls short of its potential due to clunky gameplay mechanics, technical issues, lack of polish, and a failure to deliver a compelling and immersive experience. While the concept is intriguing, the execution ultimately hinders any enjoyment that could be derived from the game. If you're looking for a realistic law enforcement experience, there are better alternatives available in the gaming market.",

The money mechanic is really only a threat if you overspend. \n\nThe combat is interesting while feeling out of place - why is a checkpoint inspector mowing down wave after wave of smugglers/rebels? I mean, the occasional shoot out makes sense but ambushed almost every time you run around?\n\nAlso, if there is a giant police HQ, why are you fighting these folks?\n\nAnd, of course, there is a somewhat out of place stealth mission. \n\nThe good:\n\nThis game scratches that itch \"Paper's please\" excelled at. You'll need to check paper work across multiple documents requiring cross references and seal verification and verifying a manifest isn't off by more than an item or a vehicle weight exceeds it's certification. \n\nThen, when you get a smuggler, the fun of tearing apart a vehicle and looking for smuggler stamps. There is nothing like thinking you've found every bit of contraband but then checking one last time in the engine bay only to see a pouch of contraband hidden away. \n\nThe mundanes of transporting prisoners and contraband is fun and is coupled with an out of paying for it to be done for you if you are not interested. A blackmarket would have been nice to resell things for more than the paltry amount you get from Police HQ. \n\nThe dev would do better focusing on the already polished inspection mechanics coupled with base building(such as a switch that deploys spikes to stop a vehicle from escaping) with the rare shoot out. More character models(women, etc.) \n\nThere is an \"endless\" mode in the works I think will solve some of the issues with the campaign and the dev has shown willingness to keep building this game. With enough work, a $5-$10 campaign expansion that greatly improves mechanics would work for both the developer and fans.",

There is only Chernarus – 230 square kilometers of post-Soviet country that was struck by an unknown virus, which turned the majority of its population into raging infected.<br><br>Your task? To survive the collapse of civilization for as long as you possibly can. Keep in mind that death is permanent in unforgiving Chernarus. All you’ll have when you start over again are the memories of your final mistake.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/infectedv2.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Meet Others</h2><br>Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/meetothers.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive Chernarus</h2><br>The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night.

Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/contaminated.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take your Shot</h2><br>Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/takeyourshotv2.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Install Mods</h2><br>Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits.

Gunshots don't register, suppressed shots pull every zombie with a 20 km radius. Zombie path finding is absurd, you run through the woods, through 15 buildings across a river and over a mountain and the zombie chasing you is on your ass and not even broken a sweat. Loot spawn sucks. You get hungry / die of starvation way too quickly. Trying to constantly repair your gear sucks. Weapons break after 5 swings/shots. Sickness sucks, in the \"cold\" for 2 seconds? Fatally ill. The new sprain/broken leg system sucks, get hit by one zombie? Broken leg, wince and blurred screen with every step. Oh and good f**king luck finding a vehicle.\n\nGame is just laborious.  After all this time they've made it prettier, it gets good frame rates. But what does it matter when the core game is still ass.",

There's very little fun about finding an item only for it to break and be useless after fighting 3 zombies or opening 2 cans of food. 2/10 and that feels generous.",

First time you will be domed by a player over a nice looking shirt, the second time you will get mauled by one or several zombies, the second time you will find food, then shit yourself to death because of cholera or salmonella, etc. \n\nThe game focuses alot on a kind of realism that can be alot of fun. Be prepared to use a mic in this game because players will kill you if you dont speak, typing isnt good enough. You can play all the way from an easy, +loot game, or a game where it rains constantly, theres almost no loot, and you will have to stop every 500 meters to light a fire and wring out your clothes and let them dry before you go on. Some servers let you build tents, bases, get vehicles etcetera. This game is a walking simulator on some maps, but other community maps are smaller and allows for a lot more player engagement. This game is full of stories, both good and bad, some hilarious.\n\nI knew about this game since like, 2015 or so, but JSchlatt really made me want to play this game. THis game is hard as nails, it takes alot to figure it out, im still a big fat noob at 40 hours and i usually die before i manage to get inland, especially on populated servers where all the coasts and first towns are looted completely, since people respawn more often than they stay alive. It can be a tiresome game, i get headaches from the grass texture after a few hours of playing, i dont have anyone to play this game with, so i play solo. I reccommend this game with friends, or find a group you can play with, preferably a friend or two.",

The gameplay is top notch it feels so fluid. The open world is perfect, there's tons of cool secrets to unfold. The game has a dope surprise if you defeat all the red enemies. The boss fights are solid. I played the first two DLC and they were pretty good although I expected more. Ill be coming back to play the other two DLC. Although the budokai games are special to me, I do have to say I think this is the best DBZ game I have ever played ! \n9/10 Amazing !!!!",

            "review": "[h1]Fantastic way to experience one of the most famous series in history.[/h1]\nIncludes all major plot points with far better graphics without some of the distracting fluff the original series had. That being said, it also includes some gameplay fluff that may be distracting but only if you let it.\nFor those that know nothing about Dragon Ball Z: This is an anime. Duh, right? So you can probably guess the graphics style. That being said, it is fully 3D and very well done- vastly improved upon the original series' graphics. Everything's in English, if wanted, and the storyline is a key feature of this game. You don't really need to know a whole lot about the series to enjoy this game. It is a fighting game, yes, but it feels more like a third person action RPG since there is a lot of character growth in levels, stats, and skills. I haven't beaten this game yet since I've let my son do more than half of the gaming hours I have put into it, but from what I've heard there is a lot of extensive character customization[spoiler[ after the game is won in a New Game+ fashion[/spoiler]. The fighting is very smooth and most of the time (hate it those few times whenever I can't interrupt my combo to dodge or block an attack) you can time things beautifully for a kickass experience. Fighting evolves throughout the game which is great if you want to compare it to Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, which is basically the same combos the entire game and only super skills changing. Awoken skills, or transformations as they're called in this game, also make a difference in your fighting style which makes perfect sense. You are also able to, but not required to after the first tutorial bit, upgrade your stats and gains using a Community of characters that specialize in different things to provide you with various long-term passive bonuses of your choosing. It works using a mechanic that is similar to a gift/relationship system, but you can do it from anywhere and almost at any time.\n\nThe big complaint I have about this game: It's not cooking like people mention, it's not grinding for items like others mention in their reviews (if you don't like grinding then play on an easier difficulty so you don't have to, ya foo), it's that even though you've achieved the experience levels and orbs (orbs work like a specialized experience resource in this game) to upgrade a skill there are still many times in which you have to have a break-out battle to \"train\" for the skill in order to learn it and use it. This is made a little worse in the way that you can't progress further in that part of your skill tree at all unless you unlock that specific upgrade through the break-out battle (obviously you're required to win it) needed to unlock that skill. Gets annoying, especially when you're in a part of the game where it won't let you locate and use a training node. [strike]Also, even though the new skill is better in every way it doesn't automatically replace the older version of the skill? Maybe people just don't want to use more ki, w/e who cares.[/strike]",

            "review": "I've been holding off & holding off on leaving a negative review for Darktide, in the hopes that Fatshark will finally get their act together and listen. After today's patch, they don't get any more leeway.\n\nLook, the gameplay is great. The combat feels excellent. The art direction is fantastic. The soundtrack is killer. All the stuff everyone has already said before me. The issue is their management decisions focusing entirely on making things take as long as humanly possible without giving you enjoyable reasons to stick around.\n\nCrafting is intentionally grindy, with gear options locked to only allow you to change half of the effects that are randomly assigned to it. On top of that, you have to wait & wait & *wait* for a good enough base weapon to invest your time in, only to have it roll two terrible Blessings and have your time wasted. Currency isn't shared between characters meaning if it takes you (and I'm being generous here) 100 hours to get your Veteran into a spot where you're at least satisfied with their gear, it'll take you another 100 hours to get your Zealot to the same place, and another 100 hours for your Psyker *and another 100 hours* for your Ogryn.\n\nThe mission selection is another time-waster. There are 16 playable missions on rotation at any one time, spread across all 5 difficulties. This means some maps are not in rotation when you want to play them. On top of that, missions have modifiers that add sub-objectives or raise/lower the difficulty by adding more enemies or changing how they spawn. These modifiers are *also* on rotation, so if you need to collect Scriptures or Grimoires for your weekly assignments (again, not shared across characters so you need to do 20 weeklies every week) you might have to play a difficulty that is way too easy just to grind them out (or worse, one that is too hard for you and means your team has to carry you). If you've played as much as I have, anything below difficulty 5 is boring. Difficulty 5 with Hi-Intensity is where veteran players get to really push themselves and test themselves against the worst the game has to offer... and most of them time it is out of rotation. The maps that are available are so overplayed that the community knows them by heart, adding to the grindy monotony.\n\nToday's patch is emblematic of Fatshark's inability to adapt to what their players want. With all the issues listed above, they add a shop that adds extremely expensive recolours of old cosmetics (with in-game currency) and re-enable the FOMO rotation on their premium cosmetic shop. \"But! They've added a new boss! And two new maps!\", you say. The new boss is the Chaos Spawn from Vermintide 2 (their last game), which featured in the game's first cutscene so should have been in at release. Two new maps does sound great on paper, except one of them is locked behind their first community event in which the player base has to finish 900'000 missions to unlock it. And by unlock it I mean add it into the rotation so it *still* might not be playable, or might be playable but only on difficulty 3. Fatshark already know they've messed up on this front, as the mission total has come down from 1.4 million missions(!) since the first announcement.\n\nFatshark, I don't know what you're planning or thinking (largely because you refuse to let your Community Managers do that, despite them being good at their jobs), but you seriously need to take a look at what you have planned and think about how those plans are going to remedy the issues above. Then, give your CMs range to communicate these plans to the player base. Set reasonable goals and a roadmap and stick to it. Doesn't matter how long it takes to roll this stuff out, you've already trained your players on how to wait forever with no end in sight.",

None of us knew each other, none of us had any idea what we were doing, but we all knew one thing for sure. If we were going to make it out alive, we had to work together.\n\nOur objective was simple, to assassinate an enemy HVT. We did so with ease, but the armies of chaos do not accept defeat lightly, so reinforcements stormed in.\n\nWe held, but we found that one of our battle brothers had fallen in the midst of combat and he was captured - likely to be interrogated or tortured until death.\n\nWith little ammo left, low supplies, and even lower health, we struggled to reach the extraction point which was overwhelmed by hordes of our enemies who only sought to bring us down. Three versus hundreds. Against all odds, we prevailed and made it past them.\n\nAt the final moment, before we piled in to the evac bird, we heard our fallen and captured brother calling out to us. My two remaining comrades were shaken, their morale was brittle, and their wounds fresh. They had forsaken our fourth to preserve their own lives. After a moment of weighing the risk and convincing, I rallied these men - these heroes - that no one would be left behind. Death before dishonor.\n\nThrough hails of gunfire, masses of flesh and teeth, and shell shock, we returned on a rescue mission to free our captured brother. Finding him was no easy task and rescuing him from our enemy's wretched grasp was even worse, but fate was on our side. Grateful and inspired, he led the charge all the way back to the evac zone. Now, all four of us were getting out of there alive.\n\nFour went in. Four came out.\n\nWe did so, not for fame. Not for glory, but for honor. Certainly not the Imperium. We did so for camaraderie. We rejects do not fight for anyone but each other now. How could we have lived with ourselves? Knowing that we had abandoned our ally in his darkest moment? Honor and duty are eternal. Life is not.",

An absolute shame since the core game play and level design is great but when there's no real story and no player agency (can't pick map/modifier) and no new maps since launch there just isn't any incentive to keep going. Last straw was team delaying communication on a big upcoming update on the same day the communication was supposed to come out. AND the excuse given (red day) was something they explicitly said would NOT be an impediment to getting the communication out on said day. Truly abysmal team from top to bottom. Community managers and any developers with self-respect should move to other companies.",

Why does fatshark insist on making every feature that revolves around \"player retention\" actively push them away?

In addition to not really offering that much new in terms of gameplay, they have the gall to reintroduce a rotating storefront that they previously had removed. It's anti-consumer, makes use of FOMO, and all for no good reason aside from trying to get people affected by FOMO to buy the cosmetics. Just make everything available in the store at all times. As much as I'd like to recommend it due to the good core gameplay, I can't due to the slow pace of updates and anti-consumer practices. Better to spend your money on games that deserve it more.",

            "review": "All Orcs Must Die games have been one of the best Tower Defense games made. Didn't seem like their heart was in OMD3 and seemed to be a fast cash game (maybe to support another game) that hasn't changed much since OMD2. It's a fun game for a few months at most, but the additional subject matter that was added to this game is lacking. I think most players noticed this after posting a good review, but didn't take the time to revise their review, because of the state of games today. If we had any other similar game options to compare, we would have noticed how little OMD3 has improved. \n\nUnchained had many issues, but this game seems to have a lot of the same and a few new issues. Adding more orcs on the screen at one time was nice (for a few maps) but most of the maps are small without much strategy or manipulating needed at all. Teamwork was much better in Unchained and I didn't feel like another game publisher was out to get more money than the game was worth. Seems the only thing this game did to make the maps \"hard\" was add more life and greatly increase the speed of the orcs. This made some of the smaller maps seem like the orcs were running faster than the heroes. Don't get me started on the lack of money we started with. Can't give us much money to buy traps when the maps are so small and boring. The 'good o' days' of gaming is lost with the must pay more for DLC (just to be a full game) or pay-to-win styles that have taken over.",

The AI cheats like crazy no matter the difficulty to the point I think it's broken.  It'll ignore the pop cap in Skirmish, so you'll get swarmed with half a dozen squads, multiple tanks, multiple vehicles, and artillery on standard settings, while you physically can't have even half that on your end. It seems to do the same thing in Conquest, from what I've seen.\n\nIt's a lot smarter than previous games at least. Your own unit AI is broken, though, worse than any game before this. Guys will just stand there getting shot and not return fire despite seeing the enemy, stand in place and jitter around when a grenade's thrown at them, and take the worst possible pathfinding routes when you move them.\n\nNot tried the multiplayer yet, but on the PVE side, I'd call it unplayable in its current state.",

            "review": "Rarely do i write reviews, but some wrong info in these reviews makes me feel obligated to.\n\nFriends Vs Friends is a 1v1 or 2v2 Fast Paced Deck Building FPS. Think Furry Quake if your opponent can activate vampire poison bullets on a katana while moving 40% faster. You buy packs with in game currency to get new cards and upgrade your current ones, and some of these get quite unique. Head exposure reveals an enemy brain above the rivals head for 4 seconds that amps damage 10x, which can be countered by cards like tin man that turns you and your ally invincible for temporarily while slowing you. It's a really interesting system that opens the door for many different playstyles and decks.\n\nThe maps are all fun despite there only being 4 of them right now, each giving a different range of engagement and lending itself to certain decks and characters better than others. Trucks is a compact map with moving parts and deadly falls into the road that makes movement speed and close range more important than trying to keep distance, where rooftops is 2 roofs that make both long range play and rush strats viable. The characters are much the same way, each giving a massive influence over how you build your deck, such as explosive resistance, starting with a Brasshopper smg, double jumps, ect.\n\nTo clear up misinfo, no you cannot buy cards with real money. There are no microtransactions in this game. The deluxe edition gives no card packs, just access to upcoming expansions.\n\nYes, you can 2v2 with a friend against random. Just open your ui menu, and there's an invite button on the top right. When they join, hit 2v2. You are now playing Friends Vs Friends with your friends.\n\nSome actual issues with the game right now is the progression, but as of right now they came out with a patch that \"fixes\" progression that I have not played. An issue that is here is explosives clipping your camera into the floor or walls from the flinch. This happens to enemies too, particularly to moose for some reason, making it really disorienting when a bomb goes off. I've heard of it happening with being hit by a sniper but I haven't had this.\n\nAll in all, wonderful game. If you have friends, queue up 2v2 and work together with your decks and you'll curb stomp in no time.\n\n",

I give it a lot of credit for not being pay to win and having a lot of personality but game play wise a lot of stuff needs to be fixed or outright scrapped to save this games life.\n\n First off and this is the most important point is that its entirely hostile to new players and its not even an issue of skill here, the problem lies in the cards leveling system. New players get base cards with no levels putting them at a huge disadvantage against the sweats and veteran players which will kill your player base post launch. This is the same issue battlefront had with its cards because its a no fun zone for people just trying to get ahead of the curve. \n\nSecond is the leveling and how its a grind to get new character unlocks. Getting tokens and card packs is a major grind and takes forever to get a hold of. At level 10 with 7 hours so far I have bought like 3 gold card packs. I mean there's nothing else to spend your money on and since the game just started I understand, just hoping its temporary until the game gets more content. Also that weird gumball machine thing for cosmetics, like getting tokens for that is near impossible since you need 3 and only get like 1 token for completing daily tasks that are a whole other grind fest for new players. \n\nThe characters are cool and unique but giving them special cards that are just like free op weapons isnt a good idea. I think that the characters who get free weapons at the start should either have a nerfed version of the gun or just scarp giving people weapons unless its in a card. Like use Duck Anderson as a model for this because Im tired of these guys who get to start off with smgs and katanas who build decks based around getting up in your face and having do defense against them. Like close quarters guns dominate this game and I would like to see some balance changes in the future.\n\nTLDR: Game is pretty but game play needs a heavy overhaul. New players get no love. Hope to see major changes.",

            "review": "[h1] An incredible Gem with Devs Who Listen [/h1]\n\nNot a day after the game is out and complaints heard by amazing devs have seen the progression system generously tweaked. A patch this morning at lightning speed took the progression from glacial to reasonable in one fell swoop. This feels like a much better place for the game and I'm much happier with how it is to get cards and xp now. That being my biggest complaint there really isn't a reason to ignore this one if you're at all looking for a quirky shooter that has been carefully crafted with love. I'd still like to see quests at least tweaked to \"play\" based objectives instead of win. As to the developers comment about friends helping friends complete quests. Personally I don't see such a problem with that. Daily quests get us to log in. If the game is fun enough we'll play anyway (and this one certainly is). \n\nIn addition to the very helpful changes to xp and cash gain they even added level based matchmaking that tries to match you near your current player level. It's not MMR but absolutely fixes the issue I had with some players already using level 4 versions of cards. \n\nThe remaining complaints are minor enough and if this first patch is anything to go off of will likely be fixed and probably are already seen. I still think the cosmetic coins are stingy and would still think they were a bit stingy if we got 1 every game. Quests should absolutely be available sooner than level 8 and need that switch from \"win\" to \"play\" but these are minor problems.\n\nThis game is incredibly generous. My previous bellyaching was really an ache for a game with so much promise and joy to give me a yet smoother experience. The truth is for the cost of a cheap lunch I've already spent hours laughing and smiling with my friends and that's absolutely worth it. This game is a gift and the price is a steal and if you're at all on the edge here please let me push you over it and while you're diving in, grab your friends too.\n\nNow if only there were some mini games to play in this diner.\n\n[b](OLD REVIEW LEFT BELOW FOR COMPARISON)[/b]\n\nThis game has charm, it's got ritz, the guns sound right, the music is lovely, the animation when you open the game is exciting, catchy and fun! They even have a hub to mess around in while you wait to find a match. Interesting level design, Unique core concept and what is probably one of the worst progression systems I've seen in a non free to play game. Mind you there are no microtransactions but honestly I've seen games that squeeze you for gold or gems that are more generous.\n\nAfter 8 hours of play I managed a total of 10 levels and half of them didn't get me anything. Packs cost way too much and your xp and cash you gain takes forever. Quests usually want you to win and you don't even get them until level 8. When you do get quests they ask you to do absurdly long tasks. \"win 8 1v1 games\" w h a t?! With the average win rate being 50% that's like asking me to play 16 games. Except its not because theres no MMR so if you struggle with the game at all you'll never be completing these quests. Go on a losing streak? Get ready to feel it. Worst of all about the current quest system is that [b] in a game literally titled \"Friends vs Friends\" you cannot complete quests against your friends. You are punished for fighting your friends.[/b]\n\nCosmetics are in this game and accessable with in game earned currency. That's kinda cool! Except to get them you need to do ALL 3 of your daily quests and that gets you 1 token of 3 that you need to put into a literal gacha machine to get a chance for 1 cosmetic. Did you get a bad one? Don't worry after another 24 actual hours of gameplay you might have your next one. Here's hoping you get something besides a profile picture for the following roll!\n\nThis would all be fine but the guy who's been playing since the beta has a lv 4 gun and 3 cards you've never seen before and will absolutely delete you the second you walk out with your \"big head mode\" card you just played. This is a masterful and amazingly well made game that's so close to where I want it to be. I'll change this review when I see an update made to address the absolutely painful progression.\n\nThe developers claim they'll change this soon. When they do I'll change this review.",

But we are looking for options because i feel similar to you about this,\n\nThanks for the feedback! <3"

            "review": "This is a very good game. The story is compelling and getting more interesting as the game progresses. The horror elements are very well done and will keep you at the edge of your seat. Although I don't think it's one of the best psychological horror games of all time. During my first playthrough, I've encountered so much flaws within the game. However, I still enjoyed it.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n⌧ There is no option to load your game directly from the pause menu. So you will have to spend your time to go back to the main menu to load another save.\n⌧ Some of the enemies can detect the player by proximity without even having to see the player's character model. On top of that, the game doesn't give you enough resource to detect the enemies' positions.\n⌧ Once you get detected and attacked by an enemy, they won't kill you off right away. You will have another chance before you get detected and attacked again until your health (which the game doesn't show) runs out, also you move a lot slower during that period.\n⌧ The lack of minimap/map is a problem. Even in a linear horror game, being able to see the map is always a big help to navigate through a new area and know where your character wants to go.\n⌧ Too many dead ends in some parts of the maps. This can be frustrating if you've spent a lot of time to get past an enemy in a huge area, and then end up nowhere.\n⌧ The head wobble effect can't be turned off. If you are a motion sickness-sensitive person like me, consider yourself be warned before playing this game.\n⌧ The game still has a lot of game-breaking bugs which can cause you to get stuck and forces you to reload a save.\n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\n⌧ Interesting and very well written story.\n⌧ Phenomenal horror atmosphere.\n⌧ The sound design is very good. Playing with a headset is highly recommended.\n⌧ Very good score and music.\n⌧ Very simple gameplay mechanics.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\nSo, is this a good game? Of course it is. Do I recommend it? Yes. But is it a perfect game as most people say? No, it's just a good horror game. I recommend you to get this game on sale, but if you decided to grab this game at the full price, it's not a bad idea either. This is a solid 8/10 game, nothing more.",

Now that I finally finished it, I felt like leaving a review. It deserves that much. Also, it's everything that piece of shit \"game\" called Scorn tried to be lol.\n\nSOMA's more of an interactive story than it is a \"game\"; in the way of gameplay, it's basically a walking simulator. You get to solve some puzzles here and there and look for items to progress, and you'll also go through some horror chase and hide-and-seek portions throughout your journey too. Those sequences are actually pretty intense and thrilling since the game makes a VERY good use of sound design to make you feel like the monster(s) are literally breathing down your neck.\n\nAtmosphere is also another thing SOMA gets down well. The underwater, derelict environment really makes you feel alone and conveys the feeling of claustrophobia, despair, and finality that its former workers felt during their final moments. \n\nThe best part, though, is obviously the story, which is really what made me stick with the game once I decided to try it out again. It's a bit of a slow start even once you end up on Pathos-II, but once the mystery of what really happened to you and your world really rears its head, it's easy to get hooked and keep playing to uncover more. It's a tragic tale that ends on a rather ambiguous and, to me, unsatisfying note, but that's kind of the point given the existential themes the story explores. Even if you don't agree with the way the mind, and I guess soul, is conceptualized, the story is still worth a playthrough.\n\nThe only bad thing I have to say about the game is that your choices don't really matter to the story. \"Choices\" are more there for *you* the player to think about, but there's only one ending, and your progress and interactions don't really change (to my knowledge) apart from some minor dialogue changes every so often.",

Developed by Frictional Games, the same studio behind the renowned Amnesia series, SOMA delivers a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nOne of the standout features of SOMA is its deeply engaging story. The game delves into profound existential questions about consciousness, identity, and the nature of humanity. Through its well-crafted dialogues and immersive storytelling, SOMA prompts players to contemplate the ethical and philosophical implications of advanced technology and artificial intelligence. The narrative twists and turns, keeping players on the edge of their seats and leaving a lasting impact long after the game is over. 10/10",

And don't get me wrong, the action is certainly there. It's just that that's pretty much all there is. Every new room, a wave of xenomorphs. Trigger a scripted sequence, a wave of xenomorphs. Take ten steps, a wave of xenomorphs.\n\nThere's precisely none of the suspense of the films. It really is just run and gun. Maybe that's the best you can manage in a game of this type, but if you're expecting the tension and fear of [i]Alien: Isolation[/i] you'll be disappointed.\n\nAdd in some frustrating scripting and design flaws, occasionally stupid writing (seriously, just [i]nuke the site from orbit[/i]), and questionable progression (I used the same gear for the whole game), and you've got an overall fairly bland experience. Plus the fact that the story never really felt like it took off and was entirely over around the time I was expecting act two. Even the Pathogen Expansion DLC didn't really add much.\n\nBut as with all things, cost is a factor. Having been bundled, you can now get [i]A:FE[/i] for just a few dollars and at that price it's a worthwhile distraction for the ~13 hours we put into it. It's just not a [i]good[/i] game.",

It has its own music score that does not detract from the atmosphere of threat and ambush. Up to three players can form a Fireteam in cross-platform multiplayer. The game has an elementary story not directly connected to the theatrical - but the game will give you a sense of being a part of the Aliens universe. \n\nAliens FTE does have some faults, even after several patches. But an approach with a \"glass is half-full\" attitude and it can be enjoyed. With different Marine classes and skill-sets, players can find a style suitable. \n\nSo, Lock and Load those Pulse Rifles and watch your motion detectors. They do come out of the damn walls.",

Little to no atmosphere the combat feels stale and parts turn into a cover shooter with really bad AI, granted they are WY synths so i guess that could be an excuse for why the AI feels like its from the late 2000's.  That however does not excuse the rest of the combat which is small encounters of enemies running right at you followed by the mandated hold this area as enemies try to swarm which should be fun it should feel like every time this happens its the last stand its about to be game over man as aliens who want some come at you from all angles but...nope they don't send enough to actually swarm and its done from such a distance that there feels like there is no actual threat. i mean perhaps it gets better towards the end but it felt like a slog to get the where i was and was rather exhausting telling myself i am having fun.",

One disaster will lead to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”<br><br><strong>Lobotomy Corporation is a roguelite monster-management simulation.</strong><br><br>Our game was inspired by the monsters birthed of various inspirations featured in games, film, and series, such as the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13.

Order your employees to perform work with and on the creatures and watch the results expectantly. Gather energy produced by the monsters and fulfill the quota each day, expand the facility, and manage even more strange beings.

However, you must learn what types of work you should and shouldn’t perform via trial and error.<br><br><strong>You start with zero information on the Abnormalities.</strong> At first, your eyes, ears, and the in-game manual will be your only hints.

Monsters beyond your imagination, and you: The Manager. A roguelite monster-management simulation inspired by the likes of the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Order your employees to perform work with the creatures and watch as it unfolds; harness greater energy, and expand the facility. One disaster will lead to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”<br><br><strong>Lobotomy Corporation is a roguelite monster-management simulation.</strong><br><br>Our game was inspired by the monsters birthed of various inspirations featured in games, film, and series, such as the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Going further, it was developed with this thought: <i>“What if those monsters were real, and your job were to manage them?”</i><br><br>You will be playing as the Manager of Lobotomy Corporation, a company in which such creatures are contained and managed. Order your employees to perform work with and on the creatures and watch the results expectantly. Gather energy produced by the monsters and fulfill the quota each day, expand the facility, and manage even more strange beings. In this game, the player will face an ever-present sense of tension and dread as they progress through each day.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Management.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>“Our new technology will bring salvation to humanity.”</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Lobotomy Corporation is a newly established energy company that isolates Abnormalities and extracts an infinite amount of energy from them by using independently developed technology</strong>, or so it seems on the outside. Join the corporation, and witness the true reality with your own eyes.<br><br><strong>Lobotomy Corp. consists of several departments, much like any other company.</strong> You will have access to various departments as you harness more energy. The more departments you have unlocked, the more efficient the management of Abnormalities will become.<br><br>Furthermore, AIs such as Angela and the ‘Sephirot’ will be at your side to provide all the assistance you need for smooth progression.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Observation.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Beings that you must constantly research and observe.</strong></h2><br><br><strong>We dubbed the creatures that reside in Lobotomy Corporation, ‘Abnormalities’.</strong><br><br>You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while extracting as much energy as possible from the Abnormalities. However, you must learn what types of work you should and shouldn’t perform via trial and error.<br><br><strong>You start with zero information on the Abnormalities.</strong> At first, your eyes, ears, and the in-game manual will be your only hints. Let your intuition pick the work type that might suit the Abnormality best. After that, order the employee who is best suited for the job to work on the Abnormality, and wait for the results. In the process of managing Abnormalities, you will gain the power of information.<br><br>The amount of energy you can acquire from Abnormalities will depend heavily on the type of work your employees perform.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Escape.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>This is NOT a tycoon.</strong></h2><br><br>As mentioned before, Abnormalities are beings that need to be treated with great care. Some might dislike the idea of being locked inside a Containment Unit, and <strong>may sometimes attempt to breach containment.</strong><br><br><strong>A breaching Abnormality will attack every employee in sight and disrupt the facility’s systems.</strong> Worse still, it could open up other units and cause more Abnormalities to escape. Furthermore, employees eroded or corrupted by certain Abnormalities will have a greatly adverse influence on other employees. Employees brainwashed by Abnormalities might randomly attack those around them, wholly oblivious to what they are doing. In addition, employees may go insane from serious psychic trauma, disobeying your orders and damaging the psyche of other employees around them.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Suppression.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>One disaster leads to another, until everything has fallen into chaos.</strong></h2><br><br>If you fail to resolve a situation immediately, it will ultimately spiral out of control and throw the whole facility into chaos. When such a situation does occur, you will have to gather employees to suppress any threat and regain control of the situation, or give up parts of the facility to ensure the company’s safety.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/568220/extras/Steambanner_Story1.png?t=1636694188\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>“Tell me, manager. Do you have any wishes?”</strong></h2><br><br>The game consists of two main portions: Monster Management and visual Story Segments.<br>Once a day of managing Abnormalities and producing energy ends, the story segment will follow right afterward.<br><br><strong>In the Story Segments, dialogue with Angela (the AI you’ll also be seeing occasionally in the management portion of the game) and the Sephirot will play.</strong> As you progress through the missions they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden deep in the company. You may have to ask questions, or answer questions from others. Here, you will uncover the secrets surrounding the company and yourself, and mayhaps even more.<br><br>“Hello, X.”<br>“I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”",

The 'retry day' button will be your best and closest friend right next to 'memory repository.' If you don't grind for the gear, the levels, and to complete missions, you're going to have a rough time. \n\nMost of the tutorial is 'do this and only this' but it's good for people who don't have a clue as to what they're doing. All the extra information can be found in the manual, alongside some sweet sweet lore. Such as the reason the clerks carry a handgun, of which they're told is for self defense, but they'll learn it's use \"when the time comes.\" (;  However, I encourage those who have friends who have played the game before teach them the basics outside of the tutorial levels. I have taught some new players over Discord, it's time efficient, and less confusing.\n\nThe story is, in my opinion, the best part of this game. They have explanations for nearly everything, including why everything looks cute and cartoony. The characters and their development is fantastic and satisfying as they talk about their backstory and you learn about their personalities. The fact that most of the Abnormalities and the story itself is based off of various books and literature.\n\nUnbeknownst to many, this game is for those who enjoy improvement through failure, and the roller coaster of emotions that comes with. And trust me, I mean it when I say that. One day in the game will be peaceful, no Abnormality breaches, no Agent deaths, and man, you got all the easy Ordeals! Then the next day you get a funny looking thing you can have your Agents work with. It hasn't done anything all day, and you decide, \"Well, seems harmless. There's only 86 seconds left to fill out it's log, so let's just get that out of the way while I train my Agents.\" Then your AI's are spamming you with reports, all you can hear is wind and static, and as you sit in your silly little manager's room, everything on fire around you, you check the last bit of the log that was just filled out... \"Past 90 seconds of work the employee dies and all breach counters are reduced to 0.\" It is at this point, you close the window, and sit there as everything burns. An occasional \"Hello?\" is heard in the vast reaches of your facility as you smile and sit in silence. The lights go out, frames drop to 0, and your hot AI Secretary comes in to tell you, once again, that you're a failure of a manager. Yet for some, ungodly reason, you manage the strength to hit ESC and then slap the 'Retry Day' button once again. \n\nIt is at this moment, you will realize you love this game. All of it's horrible auto pathing, the micromanaging of your Agents in a fight, the neutral music, and gloriously anticipated moment second trumpet drops. You'll smile, laugh, cry, and feel like you're having a heart attack on day 49 like all the other fans of the game. And maybe you'll find yourself repeating the process over and over again like me.\n\nTLDR; Hot AI Manager, Juicy Lore/Character Development, Time Travel, Frames Drop to 0, Lots of Death, Da Capo Al Fine.",

            "review": "[h1]What in the world did I just play and why did it work?[/h1]\n82 hours to get the true ending in this roguelite management rng-fest (yes, that's the summary you're gonna get). In short:\n\nThe good:\nStory, worldbuilding\nGameplay\nBoss fights (in a management game hell yeah)\n\nThe neutral:\nMusic\nGrind\n\nThe bad:\nRNG\n\n[b]Story[/b]\n\nWithout the story, this game wouldn't be nearly as good as it is. But puzzling together what happened in a lab in the Outskirts, and why that relates to gaining energy from monstrous creatures called abnormalities, while assisted by humanlike AI called Sephirot (all with their own personality and problems) is very enjoyable. The story is given in bits and pieces, out of chronological order and altogether vaguely, which leads to a rather intriguing task of figuring out what went/is going on.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nThe gameplay sounds rather simple. You have employees who you can send to work with abnormalities to obtain energy to fill the daily quota. Depending on the employee, the abnormality, the type of work and RNG you will produce more or less energy and the abnormality will or will not get more unhappy. If an abnormality is fully unhappy, bad things happen ranging from employee deaths due to abnormality breakout to... more deaths usually.\nThe interesting part is that after working with a number of abnormalities, a meltdown occurs. Either, it puts a qliphot meltdown on some random abnormalities which can be removed by working with them, but makes them unhappy if left unattended, or it spawns an ordeal in your facility, forcing combat.\nCombat, due to ordeals or escaped abnormalities, can go from simply sending in a blob of high-level employees to micromanaging to avoid attacks, depending on the threat you're up against. All in all, the gameplay loop is nicely put together.\n\n[b]Boss fights[/b]\n\nThere are no story spoilers here, but I wanted to tag it anyways.\n[spoiler]Boss fights, also known as Sephirot meltdowns, introduce a gimmick for a day and reward you with a buff if you beat them. They are varied and a nice breakup of the regular gameplay loop, and several of them are quite challenging (especially the final boss gauntlet).[/spoiler]\n\n\n[b]Music[/b]\n\nAlthough it's nothing special, the music is fitting and doesn't disturb the other elements of the game.\n\n[b]Grind[/b]\n\nYes, it's one of those. You level up employees by working with abnormalities, and in principle days are infinite. You almost have to level agents further than you would just by reaching the quota, since later boss fights require a bunch of high level employees to deal with everything going on at the same time. Furthermore, to get true ending, you need to have seen every abnormality and filled out their entire bio. This'll take at least two full runs, likely three since RNG isn't in your favour and your first run isn't likely to get all the way to the end if you're unprepared.\n\n[b]RNG[/b]\n\nOh boy, RNG. The energy you get from working, which abnormalities you get, which ordeal you get, where the ordeals spawn, what abnormalities get a qliphot meltdown, this game is jam-packed with RNG and at several occasions good or bad RNG is the difference between succeeding and having to retry the day (I'm looking at you, Queen of Hatred!). Especially bosses can be highly dependant on a role of the dice, with a wrong role almost forfeiting the attempt.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nStory is good, gameplay is good, until you get to the third run and start to prepare/(grind) for the final boss gauntlet. It's rewarding to complete though, and the story makes most of it worth it.",

Its soundtracks, story, game mechanics, Abnormalities and so on.\n\nIt was a difficult game that required a lot of trial and error, and as someone who aspire to be a completionist, I despise the thought of even a death occurring to one of my agents. Something less than S rank is disgusting, tho people can play with their own playstyle. \nI definitely wouldn't recommend if you hate repetition because you need to repeat a day a lot. But if you know more, it would be easier. It wasn't all good and sunshine, because there were some days that made me suffer again and again, and I made a grave mistake that needs me to restart all over again. Thank goodness there are mods.\n\n\nIn short, it was a game that made me learn true despair and insanity as you see victory within your grasp only for it to disappear over and over again.",

I heard people describe it a lot as being unfair, unforgiving, hating the player, ETC. and that stuff kind of made me think it sounded like it'd be unfun for the sake of being tough, but actually... Most things happen for reasons you can play around, avoid, or be on the lookout for, and the ability to restart a day with what you've learned really makes it feel like Learning the game, rather than just being destroyed again and again for no reason. \nPlus, there are a good handful of different things to motivate gameplay and interacting with things out of your comfort zone, which I appreciate. Abnormality gifts add some priority to try and get your workers interacting with more than just whoever's easy to access and deal with, and the ability to train a worker's stats by using the related work method means there's incentive to have workers do things you know another would already be good at.\n\nIf you have any sliver of interest in this game, I'd say pick it up and try it out. This is the type of game that makes me remember why I enjoy games. It's a good experience.\nI know I only have 10 hours, and I haven't even reached the midgame, but I've really enjoyed every moment spent with this game so far, so I can easily say I recommend it.",

I think my playtime over that duration speaks for itself here.\n\nThe game looks extremely hack and slashy, so I put off checking it out for a long time. That was a mistake. It's surprisingly in-depth with both build variety and combat mechanics. If you want a hack and slash game, the lower difficulties are fine for that, but if you're like me and want something that's going to challenge you and force you to optimize your builds, there's content for that as well.\n\nMy only complaint is that some of the DLC weaponry is clearly stronger than the vanilla weaponry, but as far as the vanilla content in the game goes, the vanilla weaponry can handle the content in the hands of a good player anyway. DLCs just offer that extra edge...",

            "review": " I got into Warhammer thanks to Total War Warhammer 1 and 2. After a friend told me about a first person game set in the world of Warhammer I decided to give it a shot. It was a great decision because Warhammer Vermintide 2 is an amazing game for both fans of Warhammer and people that have no idea or don't care about the setting and lore. The game is similar to Left for Dead, 4 characters go from point A to B while fighting enemies and completing objectives. At the end of some chapters and levels you will fight a boss and or a large horde of enemies.\n The game focuses on melee combat and some gunplay (depending on which character you play as) and one character uses magic. For me I prefer guns and ranged fighting in most games however the melee combat is so good that I have a blast getting up close and personal with great swords, spears and ax's. Aside from the games good range of melee and ranged weapons, you also have a range of powers, hand bombs and power-ups to help you during missions. The game has a large number of missions, bonus content and challenges even if you do not buy any of the DLC's that can be brought fro the store. As of right now, the game is still getting support and content at a slow but steady pace.\n I enjoy the game for a number of reasons. I love the combat, the wide range of weapons, the great visuals and of course the setting. I think that is one of the bigger reasons why I like Vermintide. I fell in love with the Warhammer world thanks to Total War Warhammer and to have a game that takes you right into the World of Warhammer is great. Bouncing back and forth from this game and Total War Warhammer 3 provides endless fun for me.\n I love the five playable characters and the Tavern owner who gives you missions. The banter from the characters is great, although it does help if you know some Warhammer lore beforehand. I am a huge fan of the game, however I do have some issues with this game that will probably never be addressed. The first is the fact that the game is only 4 player Co-Op, not five despite the fact that there are five characters and the game makes it seem like all 5 go out to complete missions together. While 4 player Co-Op is great and it could have been worse (Destiny with 3 player Co-Op outside of cancerous raids comes to mind) it still would make the game even better gameplay and lore wise.\n There is even a character who makes a joke about the lack of 5 player Co-Op multiple times during missions. Another issue I have is lack enemy faction variety. The game does have a wide variety of enemies thanks to the fact that you fight 3 enemy factions. However the game has not added any new enemy factions since the Beastmen came out and new enemies are for the most part never added. At first this is not a big deal, but when you fight Skaven for the 1000th time and when you learn about the massive variety of hostile factions you could and should be fighting (Vampire Counts, other Chaos Gods) you will end up wishing for new factions and enemies to fight.\n Aside from these issues and a few bugs that are not too bothersome, I really enjoy Vermintide and recommend it for Warhammer fans and fans of games like Left for Dead and Payday. May SIGMAR grant this game a long life, and hopefully more Warhammer games.\n",

            "review": "*No spoilers*\n\nGenerally:\nThis game is pretty damn good. I think I can say I'm a fan. If you played until dawn, its pretty similar. A pretty balanced amount of interactive quick time event cut scenes as well as little moments in the game that allow you to explore a find things like clues and tarot cards and other interact-able things. The only frustrating thing though is that sometimes its impossible to tell if the next thing you press A on will send you to the next scene, or if it will allow you to keep exploring. The other thing is that you really gotta be careful about which moves you make at times because you might make a decision that just straight up gets a character killed and there is nothing you can do about it. However, a majority of the time its pretty controllable. You really have to play this game multiple times through to truly understand what happens after which move you make. I think this game is more for people who want a good story (and be able to manipulate it!).\n\nThe story:\nThe general story sounds pretty stereotypical and generic, but I was anxious and genuinely surprised the entire playthrough of this story.  Most if not all of this story is pretty exciting and unpredictable. The rest of the game is trying to put the pieces together and understanding what is going on. There really is a lot of parts to the story that kept me on the edge of my seat. The way they conveyed this story in the way that they did, made it so good. The mischievousness of the chronology of this game was amazing, and it wasn't confusing to follow along with. It was also really satisfying to find clues and figure out details of the story, to be later confirmed by a character explaining what is happening. \n\nQuick time Events (QTE's)\nThere is a whole bunch of these. In action packed points, and even in calmer moments of the game. Its a cool idea, and it keeps the player's attention when watching long unskippable cutscenes. I honestly thought this game would be boring and more like a movie, but its really not. QTE's are placed generously and I think that there is not too much and not too little. Im probably gonna play this multiple times through. \n\n\nOne last thing for the developers and I guess anyone else:\nPLEASE PLEASE do something about the credits. It was insatiably excruciating to have to sit on the UNSKIPPABLE credits screen for 25+ minutes. This is such a heinous way to end this game. I liked the little updates after the game ended on every character, which was fine, but maybe instead of making us sit through the entire goddamn credits to get a stupid achievement and have the game actually count as finished, why don't you have a sanctimonious cutscene at the end of the game with all of the survived characters meeting up in the front of the lodge? or SOMETHING?? The podcast was a cool added touch, but the podcast only plays for about half the time you have to watch the credits. You have to watch the rest of the credits with some added music. Like literally who in the entire universe wants to watch a credits scene with one singular visual of a computer screen and the same newspaper heading for 25 minutes. Even with the podcast in the background, I wanted to blow my brains out having to sit through those credits. It's worse than going to a marvel movie and having to wait for the post-credit scenes. Because those credits are shorter. Somehow.\n\n\nStability:\nThis game seems to have pretty good optimization, with occasional stuttering. \nSeemed to run smooth 90-150 FPS at high-ultra settings, on a GTX 3060 and Intel 13600KF and 16GB memory.\nThis game is probably one of the least glitch filled games I have played as of recently that is a new game. In fact I didn't experience a single game breaking bug, or anything that was bad enough to remember. There is a very slight visual thing when models are set before the camera switches angles, and you can sometimes see hair or clothes falling from items spawning. Other than that, this game is essentially perfect, for my standards. Respect to Supermassive Games for actually testing and bug fixing the game before releasing it, unlike every AAA developer these days. \n\n\nI highly recommend this game, especially for anyone who wants a good story and doesn't care to be doing something the entire playthrough.",

In about 7 hours of gameplay, I think you have 10 minutes of actual interaction, the rest is cinematic. \nThe camera movements are limited, there is no real interaction, you can't run, skip scenes or fast-forward. The game has many functions that don't make sense. The characters' personalities don't make sense and many dialogues are pointless.\n\nHowever, The graphics are very good. The setting and the story are great. Some of the actors are good too. The music is also very good.\n\n",

            "review": "The Quarry is a lot of fun, with throwback vibes and a style extremely reminiscent of 80's horror films. The game does a really great job of faking out the player's expectations several times over, and the script provides a surprising amount of heart from the cast. \n\nThe atmosphere of the game is fantastic, and there are some clever details that I really enjoyed - I particularly liked that the \"Paths\" tracking system offers a VHS slip cover for the major decisions made, acting as though individual turning points were separate movies. The interim scenes with the fortune teller are also a great touch, blurring the line between narrator and story character.\n\nThe graphics are also fantastic, and offer a lot of visual detail such as stubble, pockmarks, imperfect teeth, and scars. One really neat bit is that the game's menu shows a 3D face of the character you're playing as, and reflects their updated appearances based on what's happening in the scene. I actually thought this was an incredibly cool idea, in that it adds to the overall sense of game immersion.\n\nThe only real downside, I feel, is that there's not a lot of replay value once you beat it. The mystery is no longer a mystery, the chain of outcomes becomes fairly obvious in hindsight, and the fact that you revert decisions after beating the game doesn't quite make up for the fact that you can't skip cutscenes and effectively have to play the whole game onwards from the point the change was made. The characters kind of walk slowly most of the time, too.\n\nAll in all, fantastic game with a fun atmosphere, great cast, and interesting story. In some aspects, it feels like a revitalization of classic point-and-click mystery adventure games, designed around modern gaming sensibilities. Absolutely worth at least one playthrough.",

            "review": "Take my review with a grain of salt because I started right after 1.0 release. I just started solo missions after 210 hours played so most of my experience is random multiplayer. This is one game that's very hard to convince friends to play. That's alright though, I made several friends within random Barotrauma games so I have people to play with now. The best part, is the sheer amount of people from different countries you play with.\n\nI'm a person that thrives on multiplayer games, and particularly ones that make jumping into random games enjoyable. Barotrauma gives you a completely unique experience when it comes to being \"enjoyable.\" This game is just downright unrelenting. You're either fighting monsters, teammates, and even your own sanity. \n\nMy first multiplayer game made me dive straight into the hydrothermal wastes on hard difficulty. The chaos, camaraderie, and consternation within a 30-minute timeline was an immediate adrenaline rush. Recovering from something so bad felt so satisfying. Barotrauma never lets me down with their RNG trying to constantly destroy us. This is a very good thing in my opinion. Every mission will keep you on your toes and wondering if you'll even survive the trip. Whether it's from a really unlucky swarm with a golden hammerhead, or just your own teammates panic shooting everywhere.\n\nThere are bads of course, such as griefers but you learn to work around those types. I've never ran into any game-breaking bugs nor have I gotten a single crash yet. Although getting stuck on the hatch/ladder does get annoying at times. (especially with the bots.... ) At least ragdoll is a quick remedy.\n\nI've always been a huge fan of Europa and that's what got me to look into this game. I hope with the future updates, we'll get more info about the lore of the game. There's just so many questions.",

            "review": "TLDR: I like this game ALOT but some fixes to fighting, and mechanics can heavily improve it.\n\nThis game is addictively difficult. An in depth medical system, reputation system, and many roles/jobs to choose fun. The atmosphere is creepy and the style is pretty unique. The game is best enjoyed with friends rather than alone,  you wont enjoy dealing with NPCs and will get lonely. The lore was interesting and the ending had my friends and I hyped and curious. The final battle we were on edge but excited. I would definitely recommend this game. \n\nHowever please for the love of Jove fix some things or change them. Revert clown back to it's previous state. Part of the appeal of playing assistant was the grind to get to clown. Clown was a funny pick and useful, the ability to honk the horn in order to help the crew fix things and eventually the chance to annihilate enemies with a squeaky hammer is cool and hilarious. I found myself rarely using the squeaky hammer because all it does it revive teammates (under a specific circumstance) and the horn now only gives a stat boost and a chance to stun enemies. \n\nThe game is difficult but it's made doubly difficult by annoying mechanics and controls. The biggest annoyance is being knocked out of any UI/controls at the slightest bump or movement. A monster gives your ship a tap, you're knocked off the guns, someone opens a door and a drop of water touches, knocked off whatever you're on. Speaking of water the rushing water is more problematic than the monsters. It doesn't matter if it's gallons of water rushing in or water up to your ankles, you WILL be knocked off your feet and prevented from using guns or fixing electronics or machines or moving to other parts of the sub (And yes I know we're deep underwater so it's pressurized and probably has a lot of power behind it but still. It's usually too low to swim in and yet too high to walk/run through). Maybe just change how easily it is to be knocked out of UI/controls, where only massive amounts of shaking/movement will cause it rather anything & everything. Maybe change how rushing water interacts with the players, with only large amounts knocking the player over and smaller amounts only slightly slowing them rather than pushing them and preventing them from closing doors or stopping leaks.\n\nAnother issue is the combat. It's a 2D game which means it's extremely hard NOT to friendly fire. The amount of times I have been unable to help a friend out for fear of hurting them is massive, and the amount of times i've shot them is more massive. I don't know how this could be fixed or improved but it makes multiplayer a struggle. You can't really all work together to defeat a monster unless it's sandwiched between you two and even them you still somehow end up dealing damage to teammates. \nWhile on the topic of combat, mobs SHOULD NOT have the ability to spam EMP type abilities/moves. This is mainly an issue towards the end of the game, but it causes annoyance because there is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent or even fix it. If mobs do have emp abilities make it to wear they have to recharge for more than like 2 minutes or so. Because otherwise they spam it and you're unable to fix anything and attack back. \n\nFinally maybe just add backpacks into the vanilla game, the storage being an issue at the beginning is fun and the toolbelt could be use for extra storage but it can only help so much.\n\nI say all this because I do love this game, otherwise I wouldn't have so many hours in it and I wouldn't have beaten it. I just want to see it improved so others wont be turned off by it.",

Like SS13, Barotrauma perfectly captures the madness, chaos and teamwork of trying to survive in a cramped and chaotic space environment.\n\nThe levels of systemic depth and emergent gameplay are astounding. Every game feels like a unique story as different threats arise and your crew responds on the fly to overcome them. From explosions that rupture holes in the hull to space leviathans that threaten to tear the sub apart, there is no shortage of peril. How your crew coordinates their skills and resources to survive these dangers feels endlessly replayable and rewarding.\n\nThe art style, while simple, adds to the nostalgic feel and helps keep performance smooth even during the most hectic moments. And the sounds of metal creaking, oxygen escaping and the sub's engines struggling add so much to the atmosphere of barely hanging on by a thread.\n\nIf you ever dreamed of escaping your space station to go on incredible deep space expeditions, rather than just fixing toilets and grabbing food from the vending machine, then Barotrauma is the game for you. It captures that same sense of madness and teamwork, but with a single-minded goal of survival that will keep you and your crew coming back for more adventures into the depths.",

      "about_the_game": "Mankind turned Earth into a dry wasteland and perished, but some species adapted and evolved. Pick one of the beaver factions and see how long your colony can last.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Beaver societies</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-1-Factions.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Control one of two beaver factions: the nature-friendly Folktails or the industrious Iron Teeth. Each faction has a unique style, buildings, and gameplay traits. Choose what fits your playstyle!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wet and dry seasons</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-2-WetDry.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Prepare your settlement for recurring droughts. Stockpile on food and keep fields and forests alive even after rivers dry up. Rely on both natural water sources and artificial irrigation to keep the land arable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">River control</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-3-RiverControl.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Beavers of the future have millennia of experience in water engineering. Put up dams and floodgates, dig canals with explosives, and redirect rivers to bring life back to the wasteland. Just be careful with that dynamite.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Lumberpunk</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/Timberborn-4-Lumberpunk.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Turn timber into sophisticated machinery – from water wheels and sawmills to engines and mechanized pumps. Wood is the core resource in Timberborn, but the most advanced structures require metal. To find it, send your scavengers to the ruins of the old world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bots</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1062090/extras/bots_u3.gif?t=1684937306\" /><br><br>Supercharge your colony with mechanized beavers!

Buildings used to accept a bunch of different resource types, but now the building only will accept one type of resource, and you have to manually select it on each new building.\n\nIf i have a farming area, with potatoes, sunflowers, carrots, wheat,  berries, and dandelions, i need  6 warehouses for the raw materials, and then more warehouses for the secondary products (baked potato, flour, bread)  \n\nBefore, i could start with making one warehouse, then just add more as i needed the capacity, allowing resources to be spent on other things as the game progresses. \n\nIt turned a relaxing game into a pain",

It is not how anything else in the game works or how the other race handles birthrates. If this is a \"design\" of the race I don't care - I don't like it so I don't play 1/2 of the game.",

It has almost everything I could want from a survival/city-builder type game. \n\nThe mechanics are well thought out, and have been refined even more after the recent update. It also offers a custom difficulty setting which I honestly wish all games had! I play on a potato so can't speak to graphics, but what I can see on my laptop is adorable. So far I'd definitely say it was worth every penny spent - don't let the fact that it's in \"Early Access\" scare you off, I'm so glad I didn't wait.\n\nBottom line: if you want a cute, fun and challenging game about Beavers, this is the game for you!",

It's nice that this game only has like 3 major mechanics to figure out and the rest is all minor stuff that adds to the fun parts of the game.\n\nMy only gripes so far: \nFirst, I had a drought that took my 200+ population down to 1 and I didn't get a game over, nor did I get like a special event of a wandering beaver coming to join my ghost town of a settlement. It took me a while to figure out that I was essentially locked until my remaining beaver eventually died of old age and that the game wasn't going to do anything to stop me or help me at that point.\nSecond, the graphics are lacking for a modern city builder, the visual style fits but it lacks character in a lot of the textures and the texture quality is overall pretty low. Too many right angles with the buildings, beavers don't build right angles smh.",

Some of the monsters may have human traits, but all are monsters/creatures in Nordic folklore. In addition, you will be able to see dead creatures or animals in magical forests, these create storytelling around the trolls' everyday life. Some fantasy creatures have bodies that resemble the human shape, sometimes they appear semi-nude or wearing revealing clothing."

The horror elements are on point, the environments are amazing and the SFX/Soundtrack is damn good! The art is on point (lots of John Bauer inspired stuff), great voice actors and designs. HOWEVER, some of the puzzles was super weird and the auto-lock on system could have had some work before release. I was also bummed out by the weird depth of field, motion blur and grain combined with very very dark areas and it was hard to see what you were doing half of the times. Luckily some amazing individual posted a solution to remove this in a ini file under Windows/Users/(Your user)/AppData/Local/Bramble_TMK/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor and then open the Engine.ini file with notepad, and add this text under all the text in that ini file:\n[SystemSettings]\nr.MotionBlur.PreferCompute=0\nr.DepthOfFieldQuality=0\nr.MotionBlur.Max=0\nr.MotionBlurQuality=0\nr.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0\nr.Tonemapper.GrainQuantization=0\nr.Tonemapper.Quality=0\n\nI feel like these graphics settings should be added into the game, and hopefully the devs will in the future. \nAnother thing that other people are complaining about is the price, but I think 30 EUR is more than fair, this world is currently on fire with inflation, we're all trying to get by, especially smaller dev companies. And I'd much rather pay 30 EUR for this game than giving EA or Ubisoft 60, 70, 80, 100(!) bucks for some other half-baked non-ambitious game. \n\n8/10. Strongly recommend!",

It took a while to get the drinks because we're broke af, but hey, I got them few days later after I posted this. We never expected people to interact with this because the idea is just crazy, to our surprise it even exceeded our expectations. I also want to thank everybody for interacting and my friend for keeping his promise, I could never do it without you guys. We will never forget this legendary wholesome moment, maybe when I have the money, I should pay him back with some drinks.\n\n(About the game it's really fun with friends especially when you have a lot of crazy things to do, Los Santos has brought me so many unforgettable memories)",

For people who think online isn't playable people of cheaters, just create a private friend invite only session and your ready to play online peacefully.",

Levels are also maybe a bit shorter, so the overall time needed to complete the game is lower.\nNot much to add, just enjoy the peaceful, captivating ride!",

I think this is exactly that.\n\nThe idea of some rando coming into my single player game and forcing me to change my preferred slow and methodical gameplay style seemed like a terrible idea. The cool thing about the invasion mechanic is you can set it to friends only, or turn it off entirely. That's what I did for my first playthrough of the campaign. I had a blast. The invasion mechanic is actually really cool if you want to play through the game again. I'm in the process of getting all the achievements and medals currently. It's fun to have others turn up in my game and give me some fun PvP interactions. It's also to load into someone else's game and try and slowly hunt them down. The 4 person survival modes are a ton of fun. They really bring out the fun in using some of the secondaries provided. My campaign playthrough was mostly rifle for distance, pistol for close quarters. Survival was the SMG's and shotguns time to shine. I don't really have an opinion on multiplayer matches, I've not really played much of any of the game modes. I'm currently playing through the campaign again with a friend in co-op and it's a lot of fun. Something I really appreciate is the ability to switch to first person view on all guns. That's my preferred way to play.\n\nNot much of a groundbreaking review to be fair. I liked the previous games, I liked this one with invasions turned off. I liked playing again with invasions turned on. I liked doing the invasions myself. I recommend it.",

If you can start the game at all (lots of reports that people can't), and if you play without crashing (lots of people complaining about crashes), and if you can put up with bugs that are being \"looked into\" for months, and if you can run the game long enough for memory leaks not to send you crashing, then you can play.\n\nSurvival mode is a disappointment, lacks the luster SE4 had for replayability, and has coding issues where sometimes poor spawns or out-of-bounds vehicles end your game.  Also too few maps.\n\nThe maps are beautiful in most cases, but there is repetition (designer laziness) in some of them and you are not as free as you'd like to be.\n\nWind effects do not compare with SE4 unfortunately, and also there is no authentic plus mode, both of which make the game less challenging than most would welcome.\n\nWeapon modifications are too complex and silly, too overdone.  And some weapons that should appear do not.\n\nThe game is geared towards console warriors, and the game is cross-platform.  PC Steam users do not get the attention of the developers in the forums.  The most you will get is some lame acknowledgement (sometimes, not the majority of time either) that they read the issue, then you get told to contact support, who does nothing in most cases.\n\nUpdates are still 40 GB and up, all the time.  \"We are working on it\"\n\nMost maps are not sniper-generous.\n\nI enjoyed the single player campaign, but replayability is not as good as SE4.  If you play multiplayer, be prepared for a host of cheaters and disappointments there, IMO mostly because of all the console action that is now in the game.",

            "review": "Pros:\n- The game can be passed without killing anyone (except those who must be killed as objectives - would be nice if that was tackled as well).\n- Very beautiful. Lots of attention to details.\n- Sniper rifles have a new distance based aiming mechanic. Still it's a far cry from what Sniper Contracts offers.\n\nCons:\n- Plastic faces. I've never seen so bad faces in a AAA title. Crysis from 2007 looked better.\n- Horrible terrible stupid AI. I'm playing on authentic and it's just not there. AI won't see you when you're right in front of it. AI will however spot you when you're crouching 50 meters away.\n- Not a lot of new stuff if any in comparison to previous installments.\n- IRL something that's guarded is guarded at all times. Without ifs. That means it's ridiculous that you can sneak in almost everywhere without being spotted.\n- I can pick up a fourth gun which is the same as mine but with better modifications or the one which is not yet available, why? I can use it. If I switch to my own primary three guns, this fourth gun is dropped. What the hell? Found modifications are not unlocked by picking better guns.\n- Enemies popping out of thin air. This happens e.g. when you destroy objects and you have enemies \"sleeping\".\n- Not enough traversal freedom. Too many areas of the game are blocked seemingly for no reasons.\n\nBuy only when it's on sale.",

I also feel like the story wasn't as good as sniper elite 4 it's still worth it for the gameplay in my opinion. They added a few new features which surprised me but in a good way for instance they removed the golden skins and replaced them with camo varients which are unlockable by finding a workbench or achieving a specific amount of kills. One of the things i like alot about this franchise are the unique maps they out did themselfs definitly an improvement from their latest release the vr version which i assume has smaller maps because of the vr technology not being great yet. \nConclusion you shouldn't buy it for the story/graphics but for the gameplay.",

Nice selection of guns, although a few from earlier in the series locked behind DLC, but from what I see we're not missing much if you haven't bought them. If you're new, don't worry, you won't be lost story wise or gameplay wise. Play this for cathartic Nazi sniping action with some badass slo-mo cameras.\n\n",

But the limiting stamina meter in this game refills extremely slowly.\nThat wouldn't be the problem, if enemies played by the same rules, but their stamina is infinite, meaning:\n1. They can spam attacks all day long, making the player wait their turn for 1 small window of opportunity.\n2. When the window of opportunity presents itself - they input read and perfect dodge 70 - 80% of the time.\n3. Most of the time, combat is vs multiple opponents, which isn't fun with a lock on system and spammy enemies like this.\nAnd the stagger meter is also nearly useless due to this, even with the kick ability.\n\nAlso, the enemy AI ain't the best with constant pathing issues.\n\nMaybe the game gets good after 10 hours of scrambling for silver and getting strong equipment, but those are 10 hours I could spend in a game I enjoy the combat of...",

I enjoyed seeking out certain weapons and armor sets. I played through the faction quest line. Then I got to the DLC with the town building aspect and decided I was done, because the game seemed to have run out of content and was trying to be something else. Overall, it was interesting in a low budget sort of way. The combat was janky, and the graphics were just ok, but there are somehow not enough games with this amount of soul. The musical scoring is fantastic. I absolutely love the sweeping themes in the open world and the cozy tunes in the towns.",

I like what it's going for but it's just a frustratingly hard game to get into. Not necessarily because of skill but because it's a constant test of patience. Unless you know what you're doing, you're sinking many hours in just to get to a comfortable place. Otherwise, it's an absolutely tediously slow and punishing experience for even the smallest mistakes.\n\nedit: Literally spent an hour after this review stuck in the Marsh, dying over and over because I spawned back with reduced health and stamina, sometimes next to enemies, sometimes surrounded by poison water. Couldn't even leave because animals ate all my food and you CANNOT travel between areas without rations. I even died next to the exit and got dragged half way across the map.\nedit 2: This happened twice. 3 creatures were just sat outside a dungeon and immediately killed me, taking ALL my food. Not half, not a third, every - single - piece. \n\nYou can spend your first few hours preparing, set your eyes on a goal, then immediately get humbled by something you couldn't possibly have prepared for, which incredibly slows your progression as you stumble around to recover, retreat, or just end up in a loop of death. You need gear, you need money -- to get either reliably, you need both. Otherwise, you're getting two shot from some random NPC or creature out in the wild, spending more time recovering than actually progressing quests or your build. \n\nSpeaking of builds, they are obnoxious to even begin. Have your eyes set on a certain playstyle? Well good luck! You chose a certain faction and are locked out of an entire set of abilities that make the playstyle playable or at least easier. You're practically stuck with one playstyle until you save up the silver to buy new skills. You can't grind enemies like a Souls-like to invest points into what you need. Well you can, but you're getting things worth 1 silver and spending a minute killing a handful of enemies.\n\nIt feels a bit disjointed, at least in the early game, in its survival and its action RPG aspects. The survival mechanics aren't hard at all and the action combat is simple but clunky. The quests don't really push you in the right directions to gradually prepare you so you gotta either rely on a guide or suffer constant trial and error. \n\nBugs?\n-Locked at 30 fps for seemingly no reason. Had to restart PC to fix.\n-Stuck in water? Idk if intended but I get stuck the moment water reaches thigh level. Basically guaranteed death in poison water.\n-Stuck in tent. Had to exit to menu then reload.\n-Enemies hitting me through walls.",

            "review": "So, before I start out - I understand why this game is great to so many people. Before buying it on Steam, I pirated it and beat it with my wife and we had a blast. Now I'm 3/4 of the way through a 2nd playthrough and I just can't do it anymore. \n\nThe main criticism is that Outward punishes failure with boredom. If you die, look forward to 5 minutes straight of holding L1 while watching your character doubled over in exhaustion as you beeline back to where you were. There is no challenge to this besides your patience for boredom. Even healing up with sleeping requires going into your inventory, dropping the tent, sleeping by designating sleep time/repair/guard duty, then you wake up, drink and eat food (all which require the menu AGAIN), and then another button press to put the tent up. Its like 10 button presses which offer zero challenge except again for your patience for monotony. And very quickly, the in-game economy becomes trivial. It doesn't take long for money to mean next to nothing. And story is light to. So I found myself asking why I was watching my character run through empty wastelands just to fight more boring enemies that essentially all require cheesing. I know its low hanging fruit to talk about FromSoft games, but I find myself asking why I'm not playing them instead since every aspect of this game besides combat is an exercise in padding for time. \n\nNot a super well constructed review, but it does suck to realize that over time, I have grown to be completely bored with this game. There is no room for toying with builds unless you use a wiki or watch guides, because again - you are locked into your choices, and you will be required to run for 20 minutes at a time (no BS) only stopping to drink water, eat, and recover stamina (fun!). Some people love this title and thats great for them. I would really like an Outward 2 with more engaging combat, and a lot more QoL improvements.",

This of coarse can be fixed with time using the system and the insane variety that the different breakthroughs allow (Skill trees).\n\n2: The world building and quest variety are insane when you dig for the info an example of this is when i returned a idol to a pedestal just to learn 2 hours later in a completely different quest that i had just helped a Lich who acts in opersision to my chosen faction.\n\n3: The graphics of the game may not be to a AAA standard however i believe this \"Limitation\" to the game adds to the general aesthetic of the game.\n\nI was prompted to write this after just having completed my first flawless run of the game and gaining the achievement for having never died for the entirety of the main quest.",

Outward is a Masterpiece and I am still waiting for PSASBR 2. But yeah outward is super fun. it took me and my pal a good 3-4 attempts and about 20 sheenshots videos to figure out what we were doing, but once you get into it, theres no going out of it. \n\nand now since youre still here, playstation all stars was a game my dad bought me when i was 7 i think, because it came out 11 years ago. and it became my favourite game because I prefer the party game style fighters like smash bros and stick fight whatever its called. so PSASBR was a super fun game for me, and it also had characters in it i knew such as Nathan Drake, Kratos, Sly Cooper, Ratchet and Clank etc. My Dad played Kratos and he would always Cincinnati Slambo updog triple wigwam forward neutral air falcon kick style wipe the floor with my sister and i whenever he played Kratos.\nmy dad wasnt allowed to play kratos anymore. \n\nOH YEAH SACKBOY WAS IN THE GAME TOO\n\nmoral of the story, I highly recommend outward. \nsince i still have you here, youre probably thinking \"hopefully outward will give me fun memories like the kind of memories noah (me) has with his dad and sister. I tell you what, outward will definitely give you some great memories. Off the top of my head there was that one time that mason and i were stripped of all our belongings and forced into prison, there was another time when mason and i beat our very first wendigo, and the other time when mason and i went exploring and we accidentally found the first cannibal, and we died, and all of the times Gep saved us.\n",

Also do not expect to chain multiple skills in quick succession like a combo (I tried it. Tried to swing my sword while pressing the kick skill expecting the kick skill will cancel my sword swing it does not. their is a delay between actions and skills). You can try holding down the block button then activate your skill when the time is right helped me a lot in many fights. Also use any means at your disposal traps, making enemies fight each other, stealth, long range archery to give you an advantage this games does not like to fight fair.\n\nAlso you do not need to buy recipes in order to craft or cook anything just quick search a guide on recipe and their ingredients here on steam and that might save you money in the early game to late game.\n\nYou can easily gets lost in this game but with experience you will eventually memorize the landmarks.\n\nOverall 4/5 you will love or hate this game or both.",

            "review": "Dear Techland\n\nOK, this is coming from a Dying Light series veteran.\nFInally got a gaming rig and steam 2ish years ago, so all my old DL1 stuff is on my PS4.\n\nDL2 is overall a phenomenal game, hands down the best parkour EVER. (and yes I have played Mirror's Edge 1 and 2) The amount of control and diff parkour moves that are in this to figure out as you play is unmatched.\n\nThis is ultimately what i look for in gaming.  Just give me one massive openworld to explore and freerun around as i please.  Give me a very deep and adjustable skilltree, perks and abilities to upgrade to keep the dopamine hits coming.  I want awesome gearsets, skins, outfits, TRANSMOG!! (thank u finally) and legend levels to keep the end game going for the long haulers.  Most of these things have been provided, but definitely not all.  We'll get into that.\n\nOH, you guys need to make a Gear-set Tab under the Equipped Gear in the Inventory Page.\nWould be nice to be able to switch from my Medic build to my Archer build with 1 click.  \nSame for Weapons.  If i switch to my Archer build, then i would also like to be able to swap my current weapon Load-out for bow, crossbow, guns, etc. (in one click)\n\nAND HOLY $h!t!  let me put the stamina bar directly below the health bar.  i want it on the screen just not right in my damn face.  \nOK...that's out\n\nAs dead as the streets are meant to be.  the public space rooftops need to be frickin' poppin'.\nNamely the city square itself...The Fish-Eye.  I want to see other NPC Night-runners and or Couriers gliding onto that damn rooftop on their para-gliders, and walk into the bar or just anywhere on the roof (mix it up) and even let me walk up to them and they can give me side quests or something, like info on a rare blueprint, again (mix it up).  Imagine seeing other NPCs gliding around the city, going about their business.  Maybe interacting with some.\n(Talk about giving the city a pulse.) \n\nBTW, what happened with having all sorts of different guilds around the map.  Having them hand out missions and whatnot.  this needs to be looked into.\n\nAt night, the people should be locked up in their homes or safe zones...like terrified...like insanely terrified.  However, once that sun comes up, the people should immediately become calm again, opening the windows, doors, etc. (on the rooftops obviously) putting laundry on the clothes lines, baking bread, kids playing, people chatting in their corners, guys chopping firewood, give it a pulse, ya know.\n\nBasically, the Survivors have accepted life on the roofs and that the undead rule the streets below.  Lets embrace that more.  I want to see NPCs freerunning around town on the rooftops.  Parkour is no longer an activity of fitness and expression.  It is the evolution of how we as humans must survive in that world.  Not saying every Survivor member should be a master tracer, but i should be seeing other NPCs out there freerunning.\n\nIt should LITERALLY feel like a night and day difference.  Not just the actual light and darkness.  The people need to reflect this better, the pulse and tone of the city needs to reflect this far better.  Day must be lively and bustling with people carrying on however they would in the \"Modern Dark Ages\".  Night...night should be absolutely terrifying.  I should be hearing NPC mothers telling their children to \"hush\" and \"stay away from the windows!\" from inside their homes on the rooftops, while I'm running around outside.  I should be hearing the utter horror in their voices as they say \"daddy will be back soon kids, don't worry\"  You guys do keep improving the game.  I just reaaalllllly need these things I've mentioned to be added.  I love this game, well the DL Series in general and i want to keep having fun with it.\n\nI'll close with this...may write again\nI know I've found a good game when i can beat the entire game, finish every Main Mission, Side Quest, Bounty Hunt, Random Encounter, World Event, ALL OF IT!\nand yet, I can still find a game within a game.  When i can run around an awesome openworld with nothing holding me back, having everything the game has to offer...i can make my OWN quests, my OWN adventures.  I find myself getting lost in making my OWN fun.  not waiting for devs to give me the next list of check-boxes to check-off.  (not that you shouldn't be giving us content) I just know that i have found a good game, when i can make my own in the meantime. \n \nPlease don't give up on this game.\nThere is definitely something special here.\n\nquik recap_ i know forgot to mention a few of these but check'em out anyway.\n\n1. Gear-Set Tab / Weapon Load-out Tab\n\n2. Guild Factions - give side quests, hidden Blueprint locations, rare gear/weps, outfits, skins, etc\n\n3. Blacksmiths need to have a Workbench...for disassembling, crafting, upgrading, modding, re-rolling, etc.  (side note, let us disassemble gear, not just weps.)\n\n4. Re-Modding / Re-Rolling Gear/Wep Specs - Mods should be able to be swapped WHENEVER ON WHATEVER (at workbenches only, of course) and mods should stack.  \ne.g.  2 Slit Mods should double the crit chance for bleed. (It allows for more options in modding)  and let us re-roll stats on our gear and weps.\n\n5. Pulse or Survival Sense - OK, this one can be controversial, but...You shouldn't start out with this ability, right away AND it should have to be leveled-up.  like lv.1 would be pulse common loot only.  lv.2 could be pulse common loot and rare items.  lv.3 pulses loot, rarities and walkers, lv.4 pulses all enemies.  I mean...however, just shouldn't start the damn game off, being able to pulse everything in the game right off the bat.  Absolute suspense killer.\n\n6. Base Building - doesn't have to be Sons of the Forest or Rust, just have scattered places that we can fix-up/upgrade to add bed, stash, FT>>>, personal workbench, etc.  like the secret Korek Charm Dev Room.  \nLet us fix-up a flat or pad.  have like 2 or 3 per district or something. \n\n7. FULL HUD CUSTOMIZATION - Guys, no HUD...MEANS NO HUD...not the Chase sequence level 1-4, not the Enemy Awareness Meters that circle the damn screen when they're about to see me, no HUD...NO HUD MEANS NO HUD...Immersion guys, immersion.\nI don't need or want it, let the player choose how they want to experience their play-through.\nEvery single individual HUD option should be able to be FULLY customized.\n\n8. FULL CONTROLLER CUSTOMIZATION...FULL...EVERY BUTTON...EVEN CIRCUMSTANTIAL (assassins creed can do it, so can you)  The M&K / Controller is the medium between us and fantasy world you're providing. It's important that feels perfect for the player.",

            "review": "Why the hell is the tutorial over an hour long? I really don't think you need an hour long tutorial for a game released in 2022. \n\nThe gameplay is alright but gets dull after a couple of hours. There is no real danger at all, it takes a year for the chase level to increase for volatiles to chase you and you could just stick to rooftops the whole time and you'll never die. Even if you get swarmed, as long as your have the regeneration booster and some other ones, you could literally face tank everything and kill everything.\nI feel like the gear system needs more work, the stats seem so minuscule that it doesn't make a difference. The only thing that does make a difference is your weapon. \nThe skill tree also needs work, it doesn't seem to have enough impact nor really influence how you play. Especially when you get to the end of the health skill tree, it's an attack skill that you have to attack from above on an unaware enemy which doesn't happen often.\nThey have all of these places of interest like the recent Assassin's Creed games and it's just incredibly annoying with all the markers and it takes the fun out of randomly exploring.\nThe looting system is a huge pain, why do I need to hold down a button to loot every zombie but when they despawn, I can just press it once instead to loot the bag?\nThe enemies are not challenging at all, there is almost no variety between the zombies, humans, or bosses. \nI can make grenades and bombs but ammo and guns aren't a thing in this world?\n\n\nThe parkour is alright but also gets a bit dull after a while. Throughout the story, they give you these puzzles where you basically just look for yellow marks to climb. There are several story missions which you just have to spend several minutes climbing something and it's super annoying. There are also windmills which you have to climb to activate them as well as climbing around in underground metro stations for fast travel points. There are puzzles where you have to connect power sources with a power cable and basically you just look around and connect them, not challenging at all, just tedious and boring.\nLater on, they have a bigger map and introduce paragliders, grappling hook, and fast travel which makes parkour obsolete. I just end up paragliding everywhere.\n\nThe story is just garbage. The ending is terrible. Your choices don't mean too much in the end, the world isn't impacted in a huge way. Thank god you can skip lines of dialogue for the cutscenes, you can just start speed reading everything. I seriously don't like any of the characters at all, even Aiden is a boring MC. \nI have played some of the side quests but most of them are also boring. There was a quest where you had to do a time trial of parkouring THREE TIMES. \n\nThe co-op is fine and I like how they allow a player to TP all the players to an event however, no progression transfers over so if you want to play alone and you weren't the host, you have to redo everything.\n\n",

Still like the original and dlc more tho, esp its zombie vs human ratio, DL2 focus's abit too much on the human side in some parts for my liking for a Zombie game.\n\nTalking of flaws, choose to let x \"live\" and y die because y was so damn obnoxious to the point I had to skip y's dialog in many many places. I would have wanted to choose to let y live because it was logical but the way y's personality was written ugh i'd be tempted to save a hamster's life over y's life.",

If youre looking for dying light one in a new engine youd be close to getting it but my grievances are\n-floaty\n-grapple isnt the same as from dl1\n-no weapon repair\n-easier nights \n-majority of quests are fetch quests with lack of insentive other than reward\n\ndespite all of this i still recommend this as after going back to dl1. I miss the buggy and grappling hook and the lack of guns and other mechanics makes it feel like a downgrade however i can still see the remnants of the former game shine through in the dlc where it pays homage (albeit kinda lazy and cheesy). If you like any of \n-zombie survival with mainly physical weapons\n-parkour\n-a good selection of weapon mods \n-crafting weapons (similar to dl1 but not as great)\n-hang glider (which imo is really great)\n-dark zones where you can find higher level zombies during the day but at night its easier as the high level zombies roam the streets\n-Chases now make the zombies feel like a controlled faction who can work together\n-Choices that kind of matter to story progression \nand more i cannot think of in my sleep addled state. some of these positives may seem negative and they are since dying light 2 is not the game that dl1 was but as its own game its a parkour focused zombie survival game that has a handful of unique npcs that make you wish to meet them outside the safe zone and kill them to take their stuff but that wouldnt matter since some enemy weapons do not drop and the spear can only be thrown by you but enemies can use it as a weapon. Rant over. Game fine but not the best it can be. 7/10 if dl1 was a 10/10",

            "review": "TL;DR The story was mid, the endings are mid, Aiden as a character sucks, the quests have no likeable characters, the parkour did not feel that great, night time was basically day, combat was decent.\n\nPlay Dying Light 1 instead.\n\nDying Light 1's motto was \"Good Night, Good Luck\", which sets the expectation that night time will be dangerous and stayed relevant for basically the whole game.\n\nDying Light 2's motto \"Stay Human\" becomes irrelevant outside of the first few hours and any story points after that was not impactful. The mechanic of managing your time in dark areas becomes useless after the first subway mission since you get flooded with uv/time restoring items, and even when the bar 0s out you only take damage over time before completely turning (death). After that mission I never had to pay attention to it again.\n\nIn my opinion, the only real good point about this game was the combat. The way weapons and blueprints are upgraded/modded, having i-frames while dodging, and the overall hack-and-slash experience was decent. Too bad drop kicking anything other than volatiles and goons is basically meta as it one shots, while max-modded weapons inconsistently do so. Also, the devs are periodically pushing out events that gives players things to do after beating the story so the game is very much still alive.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is the weakest part of this game and is what makes me not want to replay this game in either New Game+ or a new save. Your actions that shape the world do not matter outside of 2 or 3 important story decisions leading to character conflicts/deaths, but the city itself barely changes. In a Dying 2 Know interview uploaded by IGN, Aiden was described as a rich, deep character, but none of that is reflected in the story. \n\nAiden is a glorified errand boy who replies to every request with a \"ugh fine I'll do it\" and is pushed around the whole time. Every transition from a cutscene or dialogue into a fight is through Aiden getting punched in the face every single time. Pilgrims are supposed to be people who go through hardships and danger every day in the wilderness and we later learn Aiden is supposed to be stronger than others, yet all we see is him being a pushover at every encounter.\nThere is also a situation later where a companion is injured, but both Aiden and them, 2 seasoned survivors, somehow do not have any bandages/medical supplies and do not think to get some from a warehouse full of it basically next door. A lame plot device to have Aiden continue the mission solo.\n\nThe \"twist\" at the end of the story also feels forced with barely any build up to it and basically gaslights the player's entire experience up until now, followed by an extremely lackluster final boss. Instead of Aiden being sucker punched to transition into the fight, we the player do.\n\nThe final boss has something like 3 attacks, 2 of which are easily dodgeable AOEs and basic melee swings. They also run away at set situations to force some parkour gameplay, but in my playthrough I shot them with a pk crossbow after they jumped and they teleported back to the first area stuck in T-pose for a minute while I sandbagged. I had to use melee on my range build so that I didn't accidentally cheese the boss fight.\n\nAfter the final mission, it reverts back to before that ever happens and you don't get to feel the consequences of your actions. You also don't have the option to do the mission again and can only continue playing sandbox or do new game +.\n\nAccording to the roadmap, the June 2023 update supposedly addresses issues of the parkour feeling janky and enhances the night, but below are my experiences those before the update.\n\nThe parkour was floaty and I felt like I constantly had issues with snapping ledge grabs, even with ledge grab assist off. If you didn't play with that off, trying to climb down any hole or ledge is a nightmare with Aiden constantly re-grabbing the ledge when you drop or jump. It also snaps onto ledges when you don't want it to, and doesn't snap sometimes when you want it to such as climbing up a lipped edge.\n\nIn the early game, trying jump up a ledge at max jump height (with the hold spacebar for higher jump perk), it was inconsistent whether you would actually grab the ledge or not. I've had to do the same jump 3-4 times before Aiden would actually grab onto the ledge. There are Agility perks you can get later that resolve this issue, but the original issue was not due to Aiden being inexperienced or weakened like Dying Light 1's early game parkour, but simply things not working when they should.\n\nEven later on when you do unlock every agility perk, there are issues with some activating when you don't want it to such as jumping from pole to pole (atop the hospital), but the character wall runs instead of grabbing onto the pole. Some input based actions like Slide also don't work half the time - could be user error though.\n\nDoing things at night felt no different than the day. Every night was a full moon and flashlights had infinite battery, so it ended up being a darker \"day\". You also don't see co-op partner flashlights, which was a strange change.\n\nVolatiles were extremely rare, only appearing when you go into dark zones during the day or by causing a level 4 chase which you have to intentionally trigger. If you do run into any, they are usually alone and camped around a flare so you are never in danger of being ambushed by one, and even if you do they are pretty weak. Unless you get swarmed, it was never difficult to get around during the night. Aside from 2-3 fast infected spawning from holes occasionally while you travel and the streets being flooded with slow infected and howlers, nothing really changed.\n\nAlso, why do we even have to mash a button every time we want to open small containers like baskets and low tier chests?",

            "review": "I decided to finally get dying light 2 a year after it's release. I decided to finally give it a try. I heard this game got a lot of criticism with it's story. I do somewhat agree I was really confused with it's approach and how it delivered a lot of the characters, choices, and outcomes. but I think when compared to the first dying light it isn't as bad as people say it is. I think the story is supposed to put you in this whole situation knowing nothing in a zombie disaster. Years after the whole thing happened you step into it knowing absolutely nothing. I think that's what the developers wanted for the player anyways. Later in the story I began to sort of look at the whole game differently. Dying light 2 almost feels like it's supposed to be some society put into medieval times. A place named villedor with survivors wearing chainmail, cloth sewn together, and leather vests wielding weapons. It's definitely different from the first game where it's based during the beginning of the outbreak when you play as kyle knowing everything while in this game aiden you know nothing only your goal. definitely am going to have to give it a second playthrough to try and understand more. But the gameplay and the combat is the most satisfying and fun I've had in a while. parkour is very nice too and an improvement. I hope this game gets more flavor as the time goes.",

But it's a shame the players arent prioritized. I'd be playing right now with a friend if that was the case.\n\nThe people who worked on this game should want to do better. So do better",

You just sort of shuffle along as your 'run' but when you make a jump, while leisurely shuffling along, you make 25 foot jumps with room to spare.  \n\nThen there are the plot devices and other mechanics de-tuning.  \nWhen you swing your baseball bat at your foes, it swings in slow motion, almost as if it's deciding on whether or not it will hit the target.  \nThen there are the totally predictable plot devices.like the abundance of infected overruns almost from the very beginning of the game. Like where the companion NPC is fiddling with picking a lock of a door all the while the infected are trying to overrun the location.  \nThen there's the broken elevator gag, where the NPC jumps down while warning you about how unstable the elevator is.  But of course he gets off with no problem.  You however, are not so lucky.  you jump down and instead of immediately getting off the 'unstable' elevator, you stand there and wait the full 10-15 seconds till it very predictable falls, taking you with it.\n\nAnd it was after that second very cliche'd and overused plot situation, that I decided I had had enough, and opted for s refund.\n\nSo don't waste your rime if you like likd the first one.\n",

            "review": "Yes adjacent. Yes maybe, but I want to talk about some issues that need to be fixed.\n\nI'm at tavern Rank 11 out of 12, so the last thing to go is Distilling and I'll have literally gained everything in the game (your new unlocks conclude at 12) and I've done most of the achievements aside from literally unachievable things. Some issues arose in my playthrough.\n\nFirst, if you edit the original hotel room or the adjacent room, nobody will ever show up to rent it again. I had two guests, and that is all I'll ever have. I think this might have come from putting a cabinet in the rented room? It's unclear.\n\nSecond, editing rooms takes way too many resources. You need wood planks, which come from wood, nails, which are iron ingots smelted into iron bars at a furnace and then shaped into nails in an oven, and if you want a door you also need some sort of rock oobleck that is stones shaped into polished stone and then combined with unpolished stone. It's really unviable to make rooms over the course of what would be a reasonable playthrough, and honestly, the extra space should just be bought with money to encourage players to make interesting taverns instead of just sticking with what they have,\n\nUnlocks are a slow trickle, and things like cheese making and distilling require skill point investments along with massive level ups. I think you should either unlock them over time or put exp into them, not both. Again, this encourages you to put all your resources into one valuable recipe instead of diversifying.\n\nThe gameplay sort of ancors you at the tavern right now, and it's hard to leave because you're lacking a bouncer and a chef. If you could train an AI employee to cook and brew, or to push away the jerks who try to mess with the bar, it would be way easier to leave. I think as the game adds social systems, it's going to need to be more mindful about the fact that the inn is *a* place, not *the* place.\n\nIron and coal look startlingly similar.\n\nText has no speed settings, and right now that's fine because there's very little dialogue and one actual shopkeep who sells very little necessary stuff, but in the future, that's going to be kind of a pain.\n\nYou should either be able to customize and name bar employees, maybe even improving their skills, or they should be named NPCs with relationships. I'm too attached to the two idiots that actually work for me (and the maid who showed up twice). I need something concrete to grasp there.\n\nCelebrity visitors look like normal visitors and don't do anything special.\n\n\nAll that out of the way, I sunk 14 hours into an early access game, so there's definitely something there. It just needs more updates- more people to talk to, more places to go, more things to do besides bartending, and more recipes that make leaving the bar more worthwhile than just ordering crap in the mail and selling it.\n\nStill, decent game, and a goofy fun thing to play with friends.",

The combination of crafting / buying items feels just right, and allows for some really neat customisation I'm excited to see expanded upon. \n\nIf you're after something chill and comforting, this is a really good game for a decent price! Plus you get to hit rude customers with a broom which is honestly all I need in an escapist fantasy tbh",

Nope, Jul 2020!\nDespite sharing many elements with the aforementioned games like the same annoying mechanic where unless you’re in bed by 3am you pass out with consequences the game feels incredibly unpolished and unfinished. At least on the Steam Deck the controls are clunky (digging and tilling is an absolute hassle of trying to place and orient your character), the tutorial messages stick even after actions have been completed, and overall the game feels entirely not ready despite it being 3yrs after its release. \nThe amount of content feels threadbare outside the main game loop, the story is non-existent, and while the game allows the player to make it as fast-paced as they like operating your tavern can be quite stressful as the game feels unbalanced and prone to hectic moments (0 to everyone ordering at once while all tables and floors turn into a pigsty). \nAll in all the game has a lot of potential but has been very slow in adding new content. Judging however from the game’s roadmap under here (https://trello.com/b/CYmkOXl4/travellers-rest-roadmap) it seems that it’s been actively worked on and might become far better in the future. That being said the “main story” being classified as “very-long term” is not encouraging.",

Rain is an element that has the power to transform a games environment and enhance overall exp.\n\nCause when rain falls from the sky, it brings a sense of peace and wonder why\nThe gentle pitter-patter on the ground, creates a soothing and peaceful sound\n\nThe raindrops dance on leaves and trees, nature's symphony, like a symphony of peace\nThe earth is soaked with verdant hues, a tranquil canvas that nature imbues\n\nI love the freshness that rain brings, it washes away my blues and things\nEvery drop quenches the thirst, and revives the earth to its fullest worth\n\nIn rain, I find the essence of life, its purity washes away all strife\nIt's a reminder of how blessings abound, as every raindrop falls silently on the ground\n\nSo I cherish the rain and its serenade, its gentle touch and refreshment cascade\nI am grateful for every single drop that falls, for rain, my heart constantly calls.\n\nPls add rain, i really love rain:)",

You can really go as hard as you want when it comes to roleplay and realism, as you can create named items and actively make many of the same \"dish\" to create an estalished menue, or even small things like opening at set times. Its a relaxing game, but still requires a small bit of grinding to maintain high standards. For example, you can hire \n a bartender and a table boy to help keep things running smoothly, but you, as the owner, has to be present and active while you are open, calming disruptive patrons. It feels beautifully in depth and hands-on, especially the multiple steps and processes to create certain beverages, food items, and building. \n\nI am eagerly-and perhaps obsessively, waiting on the upcoming update. I am super excited to see the game expand, especially adding new dishes, features, and NPCs. I can see this game becoming a superb mix of Kinseed and Stardew Valley, while being a totally unique experience that can stand on its own. Definitely worth the asking price.",

You have to go out and mine every day or you feel like you missed out on the resources for that day. Clearing land is tedious, farming is tedious. Do you know what you have to do to get one patch of grass ready to plant a seed? Hit it with a scythe, then hit it with a shovel, then hit it with a hoe, go into your inventory, put seeds onto your hotbar, then stand next to the spot and hit F. Seriously, devs look into your # of clicks management. This was for ONE square, now imagine doing this for a whole field. These types of games are especially vulnerable to burnout. The more steps you make for everything exponentially adds to the tedium and eventual uninstalling. There should be little carrot-on-a-stick automation options that unlock earlier and more often to prevent this. You have to babysit your only source of income for 6 levels, while also trying to squeeze crafting and cooking in to just get the option to hire staff. All while we have the time crunch of the ticking clock. (Don't forget to drop everything you're doing to light the fire at 7pm or you'll lose half a level of reputation.) Also, why allow me to unlock bread with no clear instructions about where or how tf you get the food prep table? This game is so close to being one of my gems, but the clunkiness, especially at the beginning is crippling my attempts to load it back up and get into the new content.",

            "review": "I know I'm a dumdum writing a complain for early access game with just 1.4 hours of play time, but here's my thought. I focused only on the tavern since it's the core offered by the description itself, not farm or mine.\n\nThere's just soo little interaction that can be done in the tavern itself. Accept order - clean, that's it. The customers aren't even look alive, just an average soulless NPCs. I thought there would be at least adventurers with sword, wizard, or an adventurer party since it's has fantasy tag, not just medieval alone. Once or twice (pretty rare, it's like gacha for UR item) you'll encounter enraged NPC but it isn't interesting either. Slow sprint also isn't my cup of tea but I won't complain about that if there's more to do. I don't really know for the mid-late game but for the starter, it's pretty boring.\n\nAgain, I might be stoopeed for putting my expectation too high for an early access game. But for me, it's just the wrong time to buy.",

            "review": "This game has some massive potential and could be amazingly fun, but at this moment it's not there.\n\nThe inn-keep portion of it is actually very fun and portrays the job in a busy yet fun manner. This part of the game gets a 10/10 for me while you run it alone. When you add employees it becomes significantly less fun. The employees do nothing to stay ahead of the rush and complete tasks re-actively instead of pro-actively. This directly reflects real life, but I enjoy playing video games to get away from that. For example, when I bar-tend, I keep a few drinks pre-poured as I go. This means when multiple patrons rush the bar, I have no problem and rarely ever a line. Also as soon as patrons leave the bar I move out into the dining area and wipe down tables so I rarely ever have one get actually get dirty. I could handle 6 large tables like that without incident and rarely actually having to rush (I was even able to dart to my kitchen between rushes to cook food). Now, if I step that up to 8 tables with TWO employees, both just stand around waiting for something to happen which normally results in 3-4 tables getting dirty at the same time and a constant full line at the bar. I actually haven't seen a penalty yet with customer reactions, but this drives me insane. Also, the employees just handle the bar and tables ONLY. You can't walk 6 ft from the bar before a sound goes off to drag you back. You'd want to hire employees so you can take care of other tasks, but everything becomes stressful because when you hire employees you end up running back and forth like a madman to get stuff done as the employees stand there doing minimum work and getting paid 12 SILVER AN HOUR. You can't set a schedule either. You can't just open the bar later and take care of things early in the morning because you can't schedule your employees. They arrive bright and early at 7 am and will stand around charging you 12 Silver an hour DOING NOTHING. If you send them home, that's it, they're not coming back until tomorrow and your stuck with all your tables made for a 2 person minimum team.\n\nThe crafting system is pretty confusing too, which I should be used to with anything survival-ish. Chop down trees, mine stone, then go to multiple different crafting benches to take the material through each change until you have a final product... This part I could deal with. However, the game gives you the option of either crafting things or buying with extra money. There's a ton of crafting benches though, some can be made, some can only be bought and very little is actually explained. I can't tell you which are which and I've read through the level up screen and recipe screen like a field-guide. I end up buying everything which is incredibly wasteful, but feels less wasteful than closing the bar for a week to figure out what goes where. I will note though, the kitchen/food prep part actually makes a lot of sense. It's just everything outside being divided into so many different work areas that is very briefly explained. This needs a better setup. I'll also mention expansion is just insanely expensive. The materials aren't so bad, but it's a full gold for every block added. It would be nice if we had the option to close shop and just do it ourselves, but nope... You're going to have to spend 9-20ish gold to add a room, even though you're required to also provide all the materials.\n\nThe recipes unlocks are very out of order as well. A lot of what you unlock, you can't actually make due to a later unlock. For example, you can unlock a burger fairly early on, but the recipe calls for cheese which you cannot unlock until DOUBLE your levels later. You also can't buy cheese. You're stuck with a useless recipe until later in game. Even as I write this I wonder if there's not another location/shop/way to make cheese when you first unlock it, but as my last point said the crafting/buying process is far too confusing.\n\nTL/DR\nThere are some good points to this game such as the atmosphere. There are also far too many stressful points to the game such as the entire employee system and the crafting/buying system. When I play a game like this (or Stardew Valley for example) I would like to sit back and relax and smile. I would like freedom to explore and know my hard work setting up a bar will continue automatically while I'm out doing other things. WHAT I DON'T WANT is being stuck to that bar because I can't trust automation and high paid employees to do basic things like tasking pro-actively or turning on a fire when it gets cold. I also don't want to combine a crafting simulator with a bar simulator. Pick one please. By the title I would guess it's a bar simulator, so make the crafting side simpler. Currently this game is too stressful and complex to really enjoy or suggest. I hope it will get better with updates though.",

Really cannot wait to see what this game brings in the future, the style is adorable!\n\nNot really much of a story, but I really hope that changes in the future! There is a bit of lore though if you are into that! The only real complaint though is the furniture crafting, its quite tedious and is just a long process to get even one or two tables. Personally, I feel like it should be simplified but that's just me. I can get used to it, for sure! But i'd rather be doing farming, exploring and making food/drinks to serve to customers as well as just build than having to spend multiple in game days just mining and chopping trees then waiting multiple ingame hours to get all the supplies crafted.\n\nOverall though, i'd rate this game in its current state a 7.5/10. \n[Will probably update my review with more playtime + as the game updates]",

            "review": "TL;DR: could be a great game, but unfinished AF.\n\nI know, it's early access - but it's been early access since 2020 and for it being in development for 3 years there's just neither enough content nor much polish for the existing one.\n\nMost of the game elements seem to have been a \"yeah cool idea, let's just dump that into the game and work out the details later\". Just to name a few:\n\n* Technology tree: same concept as in graveyard keeper. You earn red, green and blue XP points by crafting various stuff, which you can dump into various perks in four categories: \"Brewing\" - allows you to unlock about 20 different kind of beers. I am not a beer enthusiast so I have no idea how meaningful those upgrades are. One of the upgrade chain is \"Porter -> Amber -> Brown -> Dark\". What does that mean? Is Porter bad because it's the first one? What even IS a Porter beer? I have no idea. Is dark beer better than brown beer or why is brown a prerequisite? It doesn't matter either way because all four sell for the exact same amount. They just have a different base ingredient. This might be a nice touch if you actually know a lot about beers but somehow I can't imagine that most people who play games like this do. \"Farming\" - about 12 perks, each unlocking new seeds for you to order at the mailbox. That's it. \"Cooking\" - Unlocks some more food recipes. \"Crafting\" - unlocks the blueprints for more and more crafting benches and decorative stuff. You could basically skip this tree alltogether since every crafting station and most other stuff can be ordered through the mailbox. Most of the time dumping points anywhere feels like absolutely nothing.\n\n* Character Skill tree: you can complete the tutorial quests or daily orders where you have to deliver food or drinks with certain ingredients in it to gain a bit of character XP. You can then spend that XP to get a flat %-bonus to something. 2% faster running, 5% faster table wiping, -2% mailbox prices, etc. - again, super underwhelming and mostly not worth the effort, since XP seems to be all you get from completing orders. Better sell the food and drinks in your tavern.\n\n* Crafting system: every crafting bench basically works like a Factorio assembling machine. You dump in the ingredients, select what you want to create and then your anvil, wood chopping block or stone worker table just magically creates all the stuff by themselves. Simply come back later and collect. If you REALLY want to get into crafting, prepare to spend the first half of every day running the same route static around the map, farming ore nodes. Especially coal. Each and every recipe is super fuel hungry and you have to feed your crafting stations with fuel beforehand. Even the anvil for some reason. If you DON'T feel like getting into all that, just order your stuff from the mailbox and you can completely ignore this part of the game.\n\n* Tavern guests: they come in, wait for their order, sit down, eat, drink, leave. Sometimes speech bubbles pop up above their heads which seem to pull text from a total of six lines or so. Can't tell you how often I've heard the line \"She was a fine, fine girl, me pig Stella was.\" by now. Sometimes people get angry for absolutely no reason and you have X amount of time to speak to them, before they flip their shit and run around the restaurant, insulting others. If you speak to them in time you have a 50/50 chance for them to either calm down or enraging anyway, at which point you just whack them with your broom once and they leave. So this random guy who sits alone in the corner staring at the wall while eating suddenly goes \"Yer looking at me?\", enrages and runs around to T-Pose behind other patrons. Overall guests just feel like soulless robots.\n\n* Brewing and cooking: just brew and cook whatever is the easiest and gives the most money. For beer there's not much difference. Most of them sell for the exact same amount. Just brew whatever. Food and other drinks seem to have a bit more variety, even tho the recipes are all over the place. Wanna brew some tea? Put in the base ingredients (tea leafs) and then simply dump in an apple, some strawberries and a whole watermelon. Voila, tea!\n\n* Room renting: at some point you can spend obscene amounts of money and resources to expand your inn, build more rooms and rent them out to guests who wish to stay the night. Can't say much about that, I had one room rented out once, decided the money and reputation from it isn't really worth the effort since time invested in the bar pays off a lot more and never touched that side gig again. Noone complained, since guests only ask for a room if there's currently a burning candle in it.\n\n* Moving: you can simply toggle the sprint button and let it stay active forever. No penalty for permanently going fast.\n\n* Gathering: ore veins are limited and have fixed locations. If they're in your way of building something, bad luck, you can't remove them. Build somewhere else! Mining them leaves an empty looking rock formation behind which magically refills itself with coal/copper/iron the next. Same with fruit trees, fixed locations. Farm them every few days for free apples, pears, oranges or even mangos or citrus fruits! What a fantastic climate.\n\n\nThere's more, but I'm out of steam for this review.\nOkayish game if you are bored and can get it very cheap but as I said at this state it's super super unfinished. \nA mix of Graveyard Keeper and Stardew Valley with ~10% the content of those games.",

            "review": "Oh Jesus...\n\nThis game had such a promising concept and honestly, a really cool gameworld, but it just fell short in almost every way. \n\nWatch Dogs Legion isn't a terrible game, and it isn't even a bad game. It's just... a game. It's underwhelming. The game features most of the same mechanics as Watch_Dogs 2, but doesn't apply them in an interesting way. It bothers me because I don't know how to describe why. It just feels really unsatisfying. The whole time I was playing, I kept thinking about Watch_Dogs 2 and how much fun it was. Sure, it was an incredibly stupid game about stupid people who do stupid things for stupid reasons, but it was really good. The map felt fun to explore and the missions and side-activities were (mostly) fun. It's so charmingly dated, as well. It's an unintentionally hilarious time capsule of mid-2010s American culture.\n\nWatch Dogs Legion, on the other hand, is just missing something. The game takes place in an alternate near-future Britain which has isolated itself from the rest of the world, and has found itself under the control of a nasty PMC that has enforced a totalitarian surveillance state. The premise is actually a cool concept for a video game setting and reminds me of similar dystopian works like V For Vendetta and Children of Men, which are both about an isolationist, authoritarian Britain. However, the game doesn't really DO anything with it. \n\nOne of the game's main problems is the lack of a main protagonist. Instead, you play as a series of randomly-generated DedSec operatives who your other randomly-generated DedSec operatives can recruit into the group, like some kind of hacking themed MLM. Each of these operatives has their own skills and special abilities. For instance, I had a hypnotist who could use her skills to make enemies turn on each other. You really can recruit anyone, regardless of their skills. Hell, you could make a DedSec cell that consisted entirely of pensioners if you wanted. I had a spy in my squad who I made look like the unholy child of Austin Powers and Jarvis Cocker. \n\nUnfortunately, the execution of the mechanic didn't really do it for me. It made the game's story feel really unfocused and impersonal. The game in general, had almost no interesting or memorable characters. The only character who I remember in any detail is the game's \"mission control\" AI, Bagley, but only because he's so incredibly annoying. There was one storyline surrounding one of the game's main villains and how she creates her corporation's AIs. That was kind of interesting, but felt kind of out of place in a game set in a relatively grounded near-future sci-fi setting. It was more like something out of Shadowrun or Cyberpunk 2077/2013/20whatever.\n\nAll-in-all, I can't recommend Watch Dogs: Legion. If you want the same game, but better, just buy Watch_Dogs 2.",

            "review": "Bought at full price on launch because I loved watch dogs 2! Refunded within 30 minutes after writing the saddest email to Ubisoft. Saw it on sale for only a handful of doubloons on steam, figured I may as well try it and see if they fixed anything.\n\nThey didn't, the world is still bland and dead, the only character is an annoying British AI and the rest are copy paste interactions with no script. Just a generic statement and a generic response as 90% of the interactions. This is because you can \"play as any character! any at all!\" which in turn means all of them are completely lifeless. What was the point of this? Who likes this? This feels like so much extra work than a much more satisfying single character or even small crew of characters to switch from. Am I missing something? Why would they do this?\n\nOkay, so the story, characters and writing sucks. There are plenty of games like that that are still great, maybe I'm just disappointed it's not what I expected and the things I enjoyed in the last games aren't here?\n\nWell, the gameplay sucks too. Every mission feels like it was randomly generated, and all of them can be solved by flying on a cargo drone. I have no clue which missions I did were randomly generated and which were actual main storyline scripted.\n\nWould refund a second time, but sadly I was too optimistic and decided to give it an actual chance of a few hours. Genuinely might be the laziest game I've ever seen, and worst of all everyone speaks British.",

            "review": "Watch Dogs: Legion... That's a tough one. This game is a bit of a wildcard if you ask me. What is good in this game is really really good, but there are some things that could hold people back. I'm glad Ubisoft was willing to take risks and be pretty creative when it comes to this game, but when trying something new, things are bound to go wrong in some aspect. Here is a list of pros and cons I created:\n\nPros:\n- The fact that you can recruit anyone is pretty cool in my opinion, and the developers made some pretty solid choices on what they consider as \"skilled recruits,\" like spies, street artists, anarchists, construction workers, DJs, and a few more. I personally think the list is great and offers a diverse amount of approaches to many missions.\n- The story is decent. I know for a fact that not everyone likes the story, but I'm personally fine with it. Long story short, you play as the Dedsec: London organization, which gets framed for a huge bombing. Now, you have to step in and recruit operatives while taking down many corrupt organizations and figure out who was actually responsible for it. It's definitely not a narrative masterpiece, but it's enough to keep you entertained.\n- There are a countless amount of ways to take on missions in the game. You could sneak in by stealth, shoot up the place, or just get a drone or spiderbot to do most of your dirty work. Many playstyles to choose from.\n- Drones and spiderbots are in my opinion a pretty fun addition to the game and add some complexity to it. Some can be used to infiltrate a base, or just go on a rampage if you really want to.\n\nCons:\n- The characters, both playable and not, don't really have all that much to them in terms of personality. Even if you just recruit a few people, you are most likely going to run into the same voices and \"personalities.\" I also find it a bit weird how the character who has the most personality is not a human being, but a computer, which is pretty ironic. The acting is also... okay, I guess... and that is only talking about the npcs. The people you can recruit were voiced by a mix of human and A.I., which is not the way to go.\n- Watch Dogs 1 and 2 had some really cool features, like the smartphone. It's very sad to see features like these not return to legion. While I do understand that legion is supposed to be different, I think the game would have been better if those features stayed, as they were really good. \n- Guns and combat feel like a downgrade, not really in terms of gameplay, but it's the fact that you can't have a good arsenal unless you find a professional hitman or buy Aiden Pearce. You can only buy 4 guns that are shared with all operatives. If they added more guns to the shop, especially lethal ones, then this wouldn't be a problem.\n- I have run into a few bugs, most notably framerate drops, which could mess someone up in gameplay especially me.\n- The game's map does not have much to it. Most of it is just city buildings. I do understand that it's based off of an actual city, but I wish they had a portion outside of London where it's more trees, less buildings, and more creative road designs. \n\nMy final thoughts: The game is overall pretty solid in my opinion. it is no stranger to issues, but I suppose everything has its ups and downs, and many people have different tastes, and that should especially be considered as this game is unlike the other 2 games in the series. I'm glad, however, that Ubisoft was willing to take risks and try something new, and I personally like the game. If you're looking for a dystopian-style open world game with a decent story and a series of diverse playstyles and playable characters, then this will most likely be the game for you. This game is absolutely not worth full price however, so if you are thinking about buying it, wait until it goes on sale. I bought it when it first released on steam for 12 dollars, and I think it was 12 dollars pretty well spent, and I spent about 48 dollars in total for the game and all the DLCs, and I had a blast! Thank you for reading this review and I hope you find it helpful.",

            "review": "TL;DR: it was a good watch-dogs game, but felt repetetive after a (quite early) point and the non-sale price is way too overpriced for this experience; i only recommen to play this game if the previous games were also enjoyable\n\nThe Good:\n-  Bagley is great\n- Bloodline DLC was a great experience, especially with the hybrid spider drone (combined bot and drone)\n- This game has some really good missions like the [spoiler]\"broken spiderbot\"[/spoiler] or [spoiler]\"heavy military drone going around and destroying things\"[/spoiler] or [spoiler]\"race mission switching between car and drone and boat\"[/spoiler] \n- Controls of the spiderbot / drone were way better compared to previous games implementations\n\nThe Annoyances:\n- The benchmark option just never worked correctly (just getting a black screen, while somehow being able to play the game with a preset save)\n- Loading takes quite a long time when the game is not on a SSD (whereas things like modern Assasins Creed games load quite fast, on the same hardware)\n- The Final / Ending mission had way too many loading screens (switching characters, going in / out of buildings)\n- Ubisoft connect just randomly stops working\n- Unlike previous games, this game does not have a feature where when the player is in a chase to activate relevant actions (like pushing up the pillars behind the player when something is near or messing the traffic-lights)\n- The \"Team\" section in the interface (to switch characters) was running VERY slowly, like at most ~5 fps after having got more than ~10 characters, whereas the game itself ran fine (between 30 to 75 fps, depending on location)\n- The game has way too many tech (upgrade) points, i am someone who completed the map before the story (including tech points), i had everything unlocked before even getting the last tech-point from the map; and then the missions themself were also giving even more tech points, which could not be spent anymore\n- There were missions which required the player to go to a specific location without any Quest Marker OR some kind of indicator on how near the player is\n- Cars that were not Police cars felt quite weird to control (though that may just be my feeling)\n- The Bloodline final boss was quite hard, compared to all stories before; especially because you could not change the load-out when respawning\n- Relic descriptions were way longer than the text-box was able to display and was also not scrollable\n- More than once a character had just been \"yeeted\" of a cargo drone, seemingly without any reason (like high velocity into a direction that was not up or down)\n\nOther notes:\n- This is the first game in the series where i didnt see anything related to the character \"T Bone\"\n- The non-Sale price (of ~99.99€ for the Gold Edition, to include the bloodline dlc) is in my opinion way too much, especially when they contain useless things like another version of Watch Dogs 1 (because i own it already) or VIP status; also considering that the game is way older than the steam release\n- VIP status just amounted to: Higher EXP gain, less cooldown after a character \"died\"\n- Multiplayer was literally unplayable in Proton\n- Many operators is a great concept, but in my playthrough it was quite the annoyance to have to switch often or having to recruit specific ones and having so many loadingscreens\n- Sadly the game was not available on steam on actual release date, unlike the previous entries in the series\n- When having a Cargo-Drone, some missions can be cheesed by just staying outside of the \"aggression zone\" while doing the mission with the spiderbot (though there was one mission which required triggering the aggression, even though the actual objective was completed, like it said \"Get to safety\" but it never triggered however far i way away, and going back and triggering the aggression and then going outside completed the mission then)\n- Map traversal was way easier with a Cargo Drone than a car\n- Some Story missions made it seems like the player had an actual choice on how to affect the world, but those did not affect much at all\n- The Bloodline DLC story was in my opinion better than the Main story\n- The Game has things like context clues (dont remember the actual name) with text and audio, but the bloodline also added pictures to that\n\nPlayed on:\n- Manjaro (Kernel 6.1.7) with KDE Plasma + Wayland + Pipewire\n- Proton Experimental\n- GPU: AMD Vega 64\n- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X\n",

As usual, i hate physics driving in watchdog game, that's why i prefer walking, but in legion it's a bit unsatisfying. The parkour sucks, also the running animation is weird. Watchdog 1 have the coolest take down animation imo, and in legion my attempt of takedown always end in fist fight, so unsatisfying. And why do people in \"future London(?)\" look like they haven't showered yet, I know the city is in crisis, but at least take a shower before going out, and wear charming outfit. The characters design are so unattractive, there are much more charming people in the real world than in this game.",

In brief, the game looks mediocre on AMD hardware, the characters feel empty, and the story is not really interesting. The only thing saving the game is the price, 8.99€.",

Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n\nRoll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n\nRoll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n\nPour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n\nBake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

            "review": "Unfortunately, the state of this game as it stands is horrendous. You can get the game on sale generally for $2.49 to $0.99, but that's about all it's worth, as a large amount of the games content is locked behind about 50 DLCs that each usually cost half of the games' off-sale value. \n\nThe gameplay holds up okay until about the mayhem difficulty, but past that, the gameplay heavily diminishes from there. The game starts becoming heavily reliant on having an extremely well optimized setup, which has next to zero room for customization, which in-turn heavily dampens your potential enjoyment of the game. Why are the higher difficulties so bad? Because they literally just multiply the enemies health and damage, even more so on the death sentence difficulty. Once you get to that point, you take such a ridiculous amount of damage that you might as well not have a health and armor bar unless you're running the one type of build that works, that being armor gating (which, to do reasonably effectively, needs a DLC perk deck). There's only really 4 viable weapon loadouts that work at that point too, using one of two specific LMGs (both locked behind DLC), using one of two specific flamethrowers (one of which is locked behind DLC), using a dual wield auto shotgun, or using an RPG (locked behind DLC). The last 3 are not viable for many crucial situations due to one reason or another, so you're [i] really [/i] just out of luck as a non-DLC player.\n\nThere are many more reasons why I cannot entirely recommend this game:\n\nThe expectation of having a 4-player friend group, which a number of achievements (and gameplay-effecting rewards) require to complete. Bots are so frequently insufficient in a lot of ways that make other achievements virtually impossible, as well.\n\nLike mentioned above, most of the interesting and fun weapons, perk decks, and skills are outright not viable in harder difficulties. I am essentially told I'm not allowed to have fun as a slow juggernaut with an M60 because my armor gets turned into swiss cheese anyway and the M60 has such a low DPS that literally every other LMG outclasses it.\n\nTactical combat just does not exist. Enemies will simply suicide rush into you with zero care and have no group tactics. They themselves will also do what would NEVER happen if this were even semi-realistic, like tazing you even if there are dozens of civilians around to potentially be shot, or gassing buildings with civilians in them. On higher difficulties, this becomes more apparent where enemies will run around a corner into the open (even with multiple guns trained on their every move) and near-instantly down you.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though, I quite enjoyed my first 200 hours of the game, and could say it was worth it despite the amount of money I sank on DLC. I also wanted to collect all of the achievements at some point, but I now realize my goal is extremely unrealistic without a well-coordinated group of four and only one viable setup that will get really stale quite quickly.\n\nI am really looking forward to and hoping that Payday 3 has improvements in all of these areas. I will gladly pay $70 upfront for it even if the only things that are properly addressed is the issues with balancing (both with the game difficulty and with your setup) and with DLC. Only time will tell, I suppose, and at least that time is soon.",

            "review": "For those wondering how different this game is from the forest, here's a perspective from someone who owns both games.\n\nThe main difference is that green hell isn't a power fantasy like the forest. In the forest you can blow up mutants and cannibals with molotovs and bombs. Or use fire arrows or flares to light enemies on fire. You can also upgrade you weapons with stuff like human teeth and bird feathers to give them a stat buff. Green hell is less combat focused. You get different tiers of tools and weapons, with stone being basic tier and metal being the best tier. That's about it, you can't blow up jaguars or natives with bombs or light them up with flares.\n\nGreen hell does have tribal native people, but they are much less of a nuisance. They don't spawn often and even if they do, they won't send waves of tribals near your location. They spawn, and if they spot you and you kill them all, it won't escalate any further like things do in the forest. There are only two main types of tribal people, archers and spearmen, no Virginia mutants or cave mutants. Again, it's less focused on combat.\n\nEnemies in the forest are all human based. In green hell, there's more variety, you get jaguars, mountain lions, caiman and other hostile animals. And these animals don't fuck around and an unprepared encounter can easily spell death. A leaf bandage will do fine against scratches but it won't do anything against a deep jaguar laceration. It depends on if you have the knowledge to treat the laceration, better yet, kill any animals before they can even harm you. That said, it takes knowledge and skill, since you all you have are spears and bow/arrows, no molotovs or bombs.\n\nFood and water is also much deeper in green hell. You have different nutrients such as proteins, fats and carbohydrates, so eating a piece of meat won't replenish your carbohydrates, it's less like the forest where you can likely survive off a single food source. And this mechanic isn't here just for the sake of variety, failing to satisfy any one of these nutrients can lead to reduced health and stamina, which can further affect your ability to survive.\n\nThis is a good segue into stamina. Stamina in green hell is also very important, it doesn't just affect your movement and combat. If your stamina and energy fall too low, you'll pass out on the spot. This will then lead to parasitic worms living underneath your skin, rapidly draining your sanity, which if left untreated can spell another death. So to stop yourself from passing out and getting worms, you need to sleep regularly on a bed. Stamina also dictates if you can light a fire, unlike the forest, you don't have a Bic lighter with infinite fuel, you need to start a fire with a drill firestarter, which uses a substantial amount of stamina and energy. If you don't have a fire, you can't purify and boil water, or cook any raw meat you have. Foods in green hell expire quickly if you don't cook or eat them.\n\nNext is the sound design. Green hell's sound design doesn't just sound good, it is also very very crucial to survival. In the jungle, there's an overgrowth of bushes and trees, so it's very easy to miss any threats that are around you, such as rattlesnakes, giant ass spiders, tribal people and Jaguars. The only reliable way to identify these threats is by the distinct sound in which they make. Hear a snake rattling? Stop moving any closer and go around the source of the sound. Hear the low growl of a jaguar inching closer? Get ready for an encounter. Hear the singing of tribal people? Crouch down and avoid alerting them. Because more times than not, you won't be able to see these threats. In the forest, you can turn off sound completely and still stay alive, but in green hell, turning off sound will get yourself killed by various threats.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about difficulty. So far I've built up green hell to be this hardcore survival game, whether it is 100% realistic or not is still debatable with sometimes questionable AI patterns, but in its core, green hell is a hardcore survival game. That said, it's actually very customizable in its difficulty. Don't want to get bit by snakes and spiders? You can actually turn it off, don't want to deal with tribal people? You can turn it off as well. Don't want to deal with sanity, there's another option for that as well. It's much more customizable than the forest. You can go in blind and get killed over and over again. But like any hardcore game, it can be very rewarding.

            "review": "Pretty solid survival game all things considered IMO. If you enjoy the show \"Alone\", this game is the closest i've played to that. You will probably die quite a bit at first while you learn the ropes. \n\nWhat this game does different than other survival games:\n- The inventory system in the game limits how much you can carry quite a lot, especially in building items such as logs, mud bricks, large stones, etc. \n- The inventory system means that most bases will be built near a water source for ease of access to bricks and most bases won't be as large as you see in other games similar to this like Rust, Ark, etc. It will take you many in game nights to build what people would call a \"2x2\" on Rust.\n- Food is difficult to stockpile due to lack of inventory \"space\". Having renewable food sources is tougher to get than most survival games. Fish do that quite well.\n- Hydration is way tougher to manage in this game. You can't make a fire if you are tired. You also can't make a fire  if its raining unless its under a shelter you've built (or found). \n- Sleep is interesting. When it hits zero, you pass out, and will wake up with some new \"friends\" living under your skin. \n- I found myself building many \"outpost\" or \"FOB\" type bases which have: Always near water source, a roof so I can make a fire in rain, and a sleeping mat. Spread these among the map and it's really easy to explore.\n\nCons:\n- Sadly all combat boils down to \"hit them in the head\" be it natives or some animal. As long as you aren't overwhelmed most engagements are very simple if you hit the HEAD. I think hitting the body should do way more damage\n- IMO Leeches being impossible to prevent or at least lessen the occurrences gets rather annoying the more you play but maybe it is realistic\n",

I dropped the game when I first started. But with a few tries, and learning from some mistakes, it got a lot better.\n\nOne of the big selling points for me, also, is that it isn't crazy dark at nightfall. Yes, it's darker, but the moonlight is often bright enough for you to move around, so you're not totally screwed in the wee hours.\n\nWould not recommend if you don't wanna spend a few hours just getting the hang of the game mechanic. Would recommend for a pretty decent survival game with an actual story that isn't too creepy (like the Forest).",

Weapon and combat is a little akward; some weapons are far more effective for combat, but less effective for anything else. Crafting can sometimes be frustrating; as most patterns are stored in your book, sometimes learning them or remembering what goes where can be a pain. Or trying to place certain items when building structures is very limiting sometimes.\n\nHowever, in terms of overall gameplay, story or just having fun with friends this is by far one of the most fun games I've played that's survival, crafting and hunting.\n\nJust watch out for the cats.",

Or somewhere in between, it doesn't feel good for RNG to take your things. Hell I would prefer to loose everything over that RNG. \n\nIt's unfortunate because there is a lot of good things with this game but it's just as unfinished and buggy as the forest. Sad",

It doesn't have the great gameplay this game introduces but it has a much MUCH better story, amazing characters (shoutous to my girl, Gaige) and the existence of Handsome Jack.",

The core mechanics and gameplay found here are solid and entertaining, and that is usually the hardest part to nail in a game. However, everything around that core is a chore.\n\nI am playing Borderlands 3 with multiple mods that remove dialogue and speed up animations, and the game still plays out incredibly slowly. There is a lot of starting and stopping, all the time, and then you have to sit through a lot of exposition from some uninportant side character, with nothing much to do because progression is tied to these monologues. Story in a game that is basically about upgrading loot should be skippable, but no... even with mods you still need to sit through the animations and so on.\n\nIf you add that to the fact that the difficulty is quite low overall, certainly lower than the two games before it, you end up with a great game being held back by the developers' obsession with the idea that they are great storytellers and that somehow this is the main point of the game. All the praise heaped upon Borderlands 2's story must be at fault here, but that was a juvenile story to begin with, propped up by interesting characters.\n\nI can't say I recommend it, even though that parts that you are actually allowed to play are very fun. It often just feels like the game is wasting your time.",

            "review": "As mentioned by others, the cringe caused by the dialogues in this game are so severe you could end up injured. Otherwise it's a decent shooter. Good amount of weapons and build variety to enjoy. The areas are what you'd expect from the franchise, well designed and fun to explore. The unique aesthetic is still there with colorful visuals.\n\nHowever if you are expecting anything like the first or second game regarding the story and characters, you will be disappointed for sure. So I only recommend this for the other aspects. \n\nAs always, they keep the horrible cash grab approach. So be patient and get either the base game or the ultimate edition during a discount, it will worth your money! It might be a local issue but for me the the deluxe edition with less content is more expensive than the ultimate..",

But hey, that's just Borderlands being Borderlands. This has nothing to do with my not recommending the game to others!\n\nI do not recommend this game because of the CONSTANT AND RELENTLESS reminders and offers to buy the DLC you are stricken with as the game goes on. All throughout the hub ship and sometimes other places as well you'll see quest markers letting you know you have a new quest available - except you can only accept the quest(s) if you own the DLC. Well, this means the quest markers never go away!\n\nOkay, so you try to remember the markers are part of a DLC and won't ever go away and just do your best to ignore them, right? Wrong. Passing by some of these DLC quest markers makes you receive an immediate radio message from the \"main story protagonist\" of said DLC letting you know they want to talk to you. This happens every time you return to the main hub and pass by it again. Some of them are placed near often-revisited NPCs and resources like the item vault so you can't avoid hearing them.\n\nThe whole thing just feels super scummy and predatory and I don't feel right supporting such practices.",

So tuning it down a little bit would be good i think.\n\nMy second point is the difficulty, the game is really easy if you do just about any of the side quests.\nHaving an inventory full of powerful legendary guns doesn't help this.\nIf you are like me and do all side missions before continuing the story, you will likely melt bosses in seconds with the only thing stopping you being their (very annoying) invincibility phases",

            "review": "Eat my nuts Ubisoft, you are so grossly disconnected from your community. It is a true shame to watch a game that you enjoyed and loved be slowly butchered by a company that only exists to slowly drain the wallets of their fan base. I sternly believe that Ubisoft purposefully brings out stupid updates and changes to slowly kill the community so that they can let the game die and move on to other projects, while also doing crossover events to steal the money of their dedicated player base. I think ubisoft is just ashamed to come outright and say that they don't want to support or update the game anymore, and just wish to slowly kill the game along with its community.\n\nUbisoft, long ago, ever since they switched dev teams, have lost sight of what siege was supposed to be. Siege is unique, the original path of the game was to have it be a sort of in-between your average arcade shooter and your slow tactical shooters like Ready or Not. However, over the last several years, I feel as though this concept has been lost on Ubisoft, they even try to vilify the part of the community which disagrees by creating the character Deimos. This brings me to the story, why the hell is there one. The lore of the game was that Rainbow Six was a multi-national counter terrorist agency designed to eliminate the most dangerous of terrorist threats. Great, stellar, that is all we needed. Nighthaven was a decent concept, but it was executed so poorly. I think it would have been great to add a PMC group to the team, seems great, but then you give them ungodly advanced levels of technology, rivaling and even surpassing entire nations, that then for some reason creeps into the lore of certain gadgets. It was so unnecessary to do this, I just don't understand why it was done at all. An actual story was and is being developed, and I can't understand why, they bring in a character named Deimos who they say is the villain, yet his only flaw is his moral compass. He is objectively right about rainbow six as a whole, it being a joke and no longer the intimidating counter terrorist organization it once was. Early on in their development of the story, they transition the leader of Rainbow from some lady to some British guy named Harry. This was the start of the fall for siege, as it signified the start of this random ass story building that they wanted to do. \n\nNow a bad story may not necessarily mean the gameplay is bad... except it fucking blows ass. Ubisoft, in the same way they ruin the story, they bring out certain changes to slowly ruin the game. Sledge is a prime example, he was a good operator, in no way broken, he wasn't even very highly picked, yet they took away his smg 11 and made him a 1 armor, and then to add insult to injury they took away his acog later on. What was the point of this, he was never broken or over picked, he was pretty well balanced, and now he is just a worse pick than buck or ash. While not all balance changes are as bad as this, the vast majority of changes that Ubisoft decides to bring out are just bad for balancing. They also have a tendency to nerf things rather than to buff them, or if they do buff operators, they don't make an impactful change. This leads to all ops becoming worse and therefore not as fun, rather than uplifting other ops and making those more fun. The last set of changes have been things such as the UI or kill indicator. They had no reason to change any of these, especially the ubisoft overlay which barely even works and somehow still buggy despite being years after release. The kill indicator is no longer quite as satisfying and snappy as it once was, which makes kills feel less rewarding and not as fun. Continuing, the UI is just a mess. It is confusing, especially for new players, and was so unnecessary. It also plays more into the concept of this game becoming more arcady and \"cartoony\". Lastly, and likely one of the worst changes so far, is the ranked 2.0 system. For some reason, people fail to understand how it works, so the rundown is basically that there are two mmrs that a player has, a hidden and visible, the hidden is what actually pits players against each other, the the visible just exists as its own thing? Like who verified that this was a working system, why in gods name did they try to be innovative on a system that was tried and tested? The hidden mmr system just doesn't seem to work, pitting what would be ranked 1.0 plats against ranked 1.0 champs. Leading to imbalanced, irritating, or boring games, along with poor balancing. The visible mmr also serves no purpose, as it is criminally easy to hit higher ranks, leading to a more than 1000% increase in the amount of Champions. Why does it exist, why are players not given a ranked based off who they play with, why is it based off how well they play against their specific skill level? It leaves no incentives to improve and only the incentive to play and hit champ. The fact that a person with a 12% win loss can hit champ is disgusting. The best of the best of players are the ones meant to be hitting the highest rank in the game, yet for some unholy reason, they just invite morons into the group. If I remember correctly, take this with a pinch of salt, I believe their justification for this was to \"reward players not just based off skill but also how much they play\". They essentially removed the ranked part of the definition of ranked. If I played chess for 16 hours a day for the rest of my life, but remain among the worst players of the game, why in gods name should I be given the title Grandmaster when I would not be able to compete against any other legit Grandmaster? It makes no sense to reward people for play time, and grant them something that they do not deserve. The incentive to play in ranked 1.0 was to improve so that you could hit the higher rank. Without the need to improve, it leaves the community overall worse. Maybe the devs brought it out so they could finally hit a rank past gold.\n\nNo words, not even an entire essay, could describe my dissatisfaction with Ubisoft and how they have handled this game. They have failed the community, the gameplay, and somehow, the core concept of the game itself. It would take an utter buffoon to see what is happening and think to themselves, \"this is perfectly fine\". Take a lesson from any competitive shooter and stop focusing on your casual community. I think the view point of focusing on it to just be completely wrong. While it may bring temporary life into the game, most casual players don't really care about the game and can leave on a whim. Focusing on the ranked community, particularly those at the top bracket to ensure the longevity of a game as those are the people who tend to be the most passionate about the game. Further, the devs of this game either don't really play the game or suck ass at it, so they aren't even good at understanding balance changes. For a lot of games, the devs are actually pretty good at the game, this is because they built the game so they understand it. I would think the devs for Siege, now being the one's making it, would also understand it. Of course not that would be smart and reasonable.\n\nI will sadly, and much to my own chagrin, keep playing the game. This is because there is no other game around like it, and frankly,  this is the only reason the game is still around. Everyone shits on EA for their crappy economy decisions in their games, yet for a lot of the games, they improve and fix this issue, and even in the case of the sports clones, it is easy to just avoid their copys. Just look at battlefront 2, it is a stellar game now but it did release to some controversy. Yet Ubisoft, rather than trying to improve their game, reward the worse parts of the community, and sacrificing everyone who actually cares about the game. They are as arrogant and foolish as Narcissus, since both Ubisoft and he fell in love with themselves.",

            "review": "i have to say, i'm deeply disappointed with the direction rainbow six siege has taken, especially since the release of ela. the game used to rely on strategy, communication, and careful planning. but with ela, the delicate balance that made siege stand out among other shooters has been disturbed, turning it into something more like a standard run-and-gun title.\n\nbut my biggest gripe, the real knife to the heart, is the mishandling of the character \"havoc.\" havoc was teased in the game's e3 trailer, portrayed as this intriguing, menacing character who was supposed to bring an exciting twist to the game. the trailer did an excellent job of building hype around havoc - the character's design, menacing aura, and what appeared to be a unique gameplay mechanic.\n\nthe trailer painted a vivid picture of havoc as a new villain, a ruthless operator, who seemed to be bringing a new level of intensity and danger to siege. it suggested that his arrival would significantly shake up the game's dynamics, posing new challenges and creating fresh strategies for players to explore.\n\nhowever, this was all a pipe dream. despite all the hype, despite all the anticipation built up, havoc is nowhere to be found in the actual game. it's a classic case of false advertising and has left many fans, including me, feeling betrayed. we were promised something exciting, something groundbreaking, but what we got was a no-show.\n\nand if the mishandling of havoc wasn't enough, the writing has also gone down the drain, exemplified by the addition of \"dokkaebi.\" her bio intro is just cringeworthy: \"her fingers dance across the keyboard, the light of the lcd screen underscoring her smirk.\" it's a cheesy line that feels out of place and makes her character feel shallow and uninspired. it's not the level of writing one would expect from a game with the pedigree of rainbow six siege.\n\nit's hard not to feel misled and deceived. the absence of havoc in the game is like a promising movie trailer with no actual film to follow. it's like being served a mouthwatering menu with no food to eat. it's not just about one character - it's about broken promises and shattered expectations.\n\nthe game has deviated from its roots, focusing on quick action and flashy gimmicks rather than on deep, tactical gameplay. the introduction of ela, the misleading portrayal of havoc, and the cringe-worthy writing for dokkaebi have made siege lose its identity, and it's a real shame.\n\nin conclusion, if you loved rainbow six siege for its strategic depth, teamwork, and engaging characters, you might want to give it a miss for now. unless the developers make a U-turn and steer the game back to its roots, it's hard to see this title reclaiming its former glory. so until then, i can't recommend this game.",

This game is ridiculous and yet if you were a kid who grew up with 7 eleven, Street Sharks, The Simpsons, Doom, Quake, Half-Life, AOL Internet, and Alternative music like I was this may be a trigger for Nostalgia in a twisted weird way. The Game is fun and for a game not taking itself seriously it has a level of detail any build engine game had back in the day. I highly recommend this game 10/10 besides don't you wanna help Zane Avenge his mom! P.S. can't wait to finish this game.",

In order to survive, you will need to mine raw materials from the earth, grow food, build factories, manufacture products, construct vehicles, research new technologies, explore your surroundings, and trade with other islands. If you do things right, you'll work your way up towards an industrial superpower and you can even start a space program! But this is no easy task and you will be put to the test to keep your settlement alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Manufacture products</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/01_Manufacture_products.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Start simple - smelt iron, mix concrete, create construction parts, and grow food. Soon you will be able to expand into crude oil processing, electronics, solar panels, data centers, and even rockets. There are over 150 unique products to explore and work with!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build vehicles and transport products</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/02_Build_vehicles_and_transport_products.png?t=1685468315\" /><br>Logistics systems ensure that trucks will automatically deliver products where they are most needed. You can configure the logistics to make it more efficient. Don’t forget to build enough trucks or upgrade existing ones to keep things moving!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build conveyor belts and pipes</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/04_Build_your_own_transport_lines.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Use conveyor belts and pipes to route products efficiently and relieve stress on truck-based logistics. The transport system supports vertical stacking and auto-pathing for easy placement. Balancers and sorters also help organize your assembly lines by providing priority and sorting functionalities.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Mine raw resources on fully dynamic terrain</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/05_Mine_raw_resources_on_fully_dynamic_terrain.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Find the natural riches of your land and use them to expand your empire. Mine coal, iron, copper, gold, or pump underground oil and water! Make open-pit mines to extract valuable ores from underground, or just dump excess rocks into the ocean to create a new land to build on! Remember that no mountain is tall enough for your fleet of excavators!<br><br>Additionally, the dynamic terrain system allows you to create access to various levels of elevation throughout your island. Dig or dump terrain to create slopes between hard to reach places so that you can have the most efficient path for your vehicles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Farm your land</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/06_Farm_your_land.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>You need to feed your people by growing simple crops such as potatoes.  Later, you will be able to grow more advanced crops such as wheat or soybeans  and process them to make more kinds of food and products. You can also produce fertilizers and use greenhouses to keep up with the food demands.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Grow your settlement and provide for your people</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/07_Grow_your_settlement_and_provide_for_your_people.png?t=1685468315\" /><br>To staff your factories, farms, and vehicles, you need people, and lots of them. Build housing and provide essentials to your citizens such as food, water, electricity, healthcare, and household goods. Population will grow on its own depending on their health and happiness, but you can also recruit and rescue populations on the world map to help aid your island.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build complex oil and chemical refineries</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/08_Build_complex_oil_and_chemical_refineries.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Break crude oil down into different usable fractions using multiple refining stages. With the ability to stack pipes you can create compact and scalable plants that can make all the oil-based products you will need for your growing empire.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Research new technologies</h2><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1594320/extras/09_Research_new_technologies.gif?t=1685468315\" /><br>Research is a must have!

            "review": "I haven't written a review for this yet? Darn!\nShort version: Recommended.\n\nLonger version:\nCoI is another entry into the genre of factory games, specifically the top down management ones (aka, you're an invisible force, not a guy/mech walking around in the factory you build). What sets this game apart from it's competitors is\n - realism-based industrial chains and processes\n - terraforming and open pit mining with actual terrain physics\n - a slow progression based around fine-tuning new recipes for higher efficiency with the limited resources you have (rather than plastering the map with copy pasted factories)\n - difficulty, by virtue of actually being able to lose (due to running into a logistical blackout, or simply being too wasteful and running out of a critical ressource before you managed to unlock an alternative)\n\nIn particular the grounded nature of it's setting makes the game oddly appealing: Sure, fighting hordes of alien with railway artillery can be entertaining, and there's a certain appeal to turning an entire planet into a ball of metal that pumps out Dyson Spheres... but somehow that can't beat actually planning out an open pit mine, and watching your excavators slowly chip away at the coal deposit, turning the 'untouched forested hill region with specks of coal' into 'massive crater stripped of any valuable ressources', whilst slowly progressing from truck-ferried loads of coal, to belt-fed steam turbines, to a self-sustained eco-paradise.\n\nThere's also a massive amount of control, notification, and QoL features. A common occurence in factory style games (to me, at least) is to go in, play, and then notice that some obvious feature you know from another game is missing. None of that in CoI, it's all there, and more. Be it blueprints, automated notifications for storage levels, precisely limited cargo transports... Really, the only thing missing might be a turing-complete digital automation system... but then again I also haven't yet run into a situation where I would actually need one.\n\nAnd, as a final positive note: The developement team. There's a lot of EA titles that just dumple around and then there's an occasional 'update' with a few bugfixes so that the dev team can claim the game is totally still being developement and not just a resting cash grab. But with CoI, you get regular updates, plentiful devlogs (even going into technical depths that are incredibly fascinating as a programmer) and a constantly evolving gameplay.\n\nSo, overall, I'd argue this might very well be my absolute favorite of the factory game genre. Sure, it can't quite compete with the stunning asthethics of Satisfactory, and it doesn't bring the action and insane mod volume of Factorio, but when it comes down to just having solid factory gameplay, noone can outdo the Cap'n.\nScore: 8/10\nThe graphics and soundscape are not exactly breathtaking, and the performance can start getting dice on larger factories (though the patch end of month might actually fix a lot of the latter), but everything else from core gameplay to polish is a solid recommendation to any genre fans. And also anyone interested in trying out the factory genre to begin with.",

I love the industry aesthetic, I love the feeling of building a cool assembly line, I love watching my little guys go do their things while I ruin the atmosphere using enough coal power to make Captain Planet have a coronary. That's why it gets a thumbs up.\n\nBUT\n\nThere needs to be some rebalancing -- in particular, with Bricks. I got to a point where I could not build *anything* without construction parts, which require bricks, which require dirt. Maybe I am an idiot, but I could not get dirt because my miners, despite my instructions, prioritized everything else. Then I hit a point where I looked up a solution! I found you can get concrete and use that in lieu of brick to get parts.\n\nSo I spent a while researching concrete, got it, and got ready to render bricks obsolete.\n\nWouldn't you know it, to build the stuff you need to process concrete, you need construction parts... which I couldn't get, because I needed B R I C K S.\n\nI immediately closed the game.\n\nI don't understand how I can create elaborate assembly lines and repair a ship and do all sorts of cool industrial magic and then can't even get a single ounce of dirt off the ground in a way that would let me work around this brick issue.\n\nMaybe some day I will have the gumption to play this again and figure out how dirt and bricks work.\n\nToday is not that day.",

An absolute gem of a game![/b]\n\nI have played many hours in variety of Factorio-like games (be it Minecraft modpacks, Satisfactory, Dyson Sphere Program and suchlike), and this is by far my favourite title of this kind.\nI would highlight three things:\n1) Progression - In this factory new technologies require rethinking of the supply chains, gradually increasing complexity. This is very smooth and extremely satisfying.\n2) Landscaping - your excavators dig the raw ores out of the ground, leaving in holes to fill in with rock and cover with topsoil to farm on. \n3) Visuals - this game goes for more gritty style, which is still immensely readable. Gradual transformation of the island into prosperous industrial landscape is very pleasing to the eye. The satisfaction of zooming out and flying over the island compares to the best moments of inspecting the largest bases in Factorio or Satisfactory or planet-size production facilities in DSP.\n\n",

Didn't know your potatoes and your vegetables need different types of conveyors? Don't know how to exactingly design mining areas so your excavators and trucks don't bad-AI themselves into a place they can't leave? Well, guess you're losing irreplaceable resources as you tear things down and rebuild them, and hope it doesn't mean your entire economy collapses because the bottleneck means you don't feed the unstoppable need for everything.\n\nIt's a fine game if you go in with the expectation that you're going to need to watch ten hours of youtube videos explaining how to do things, and that you're going to throw away three or four six-hour sessions as unrecoverable disasters.",

Automation is extremely expensive. Pipes that carry liquid are cheap, but conveyor belts require Tier 2 construction equipment. Building a sustainable setup for T2 construction equipment takes about 5-6 hours played at normal speed with frequent pauses. You mess up and miss one construction material? You are now in the black-hole of construction as literally your entire base is now solely dependent on a single resource that is being carried, one truck at a time, to its destination. \n\nIf that sounds fun to you, get this game. It's a hell of a challenge but as mentioned by other reviews, it's fantastic to watch your base grow and the terraforming take place.",
