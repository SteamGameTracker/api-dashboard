            "review": "Since the start of Lightfall and even before that Bungie has started on a path of trying to kill the game instead of making it better. Constant server issues that only get worse with each week while hearing nothing from Bungie on why the issues are occurring, if they will get better, or if they can even be fixed. Mind numbing changes that only seek to hurt the players for no reason.\n\nThe most recent stompees nerf that removes all movement speed from the exotic due to controller players not being able to \"look up\". There is also the titan shoulder charge nerf that now causes you to lose energy after shoulder charging even if it does not hit an enemy. While being a PvP nerf, PvE is being hit by this nerf due to the developers dying on the hill of not separating the sandboxes. While this change may not seem that impactful, let me also add that shoulder charge has worked the same way for the last 9 years. Warlocks are getting starfire not just nerfed but murdered. Starfire has needed a nerf for a while as it is an extremely dominate exotic but instead of nerfing it to be more in line with other exotics the developers have almost made it a punishment to use the exotic. Grenade energy used to be 20% while in an empowering rift and is now down to 2.5%. Lastly, lets talk about the incredible band-aid fixes to the game. The 2 second weapon cooldown. Now if you ever swap weapons in your inventory you have to wait 2 seconds before you are allowed to fire your weapon in a SHOOTER. To give some examples this would be similar to not being able to use the brakes in your vehicle should you accidentally press them or be on a very busy interstate, instead you need to wait 2 seconds. \n\nFinally, there is the price increase of each expansion and now the increase in prices of seasons by an extra 5 dollars. I'm not even going to get into the costs of the game as in my stance I normally buy the most expensive edition as I play the game a lot unfortunately but going the cheaper route is even more expensive. From the expansions to now increased season price and dungeon keys the game is not only offering so little for that cost but also doing nothing to improve the game server wise, it's only getting worse.\n\nFor my last bit of advice, if you are new to the game or think about checking it out and never having played Destiny. \n\nSTAY FAR AWAY\n\nThis game is the most unfriendly new player experience I have ever witnessed. Playing through the New Light aka New player experience as an experienced person shows the issues with the game and what it's not teaching new players. The craziest part is this feedback has been given to Bungie the last 2-3 years now and yet they still refuse how to teach new players to play the game. Instead they teach new players how to play a game for their very first time. For instance, they teach you that \"Space Bar\" is jump instead of teaching you that weapons within destiny have different perk combinations on them, or that subclasses have different benefits and how to properly use them in combat.\n\nFrom recent events it is apparent that the team that worked on the game during the Beyond Light era and even the Witch Queen era is gone. They are either working on one of the 7 trillion new projects that Bungie has spread themselves too thin doing or went to a new game studio.",

            "review": "Destiny 2 is a black hole for your time.\n\nI find myself coming back every time a new piece of content is dropped, but this is out of no love of the content that I am receiving. Attempting to introduce Destiny 2 to new players reveals the number of fatal flaws this game's business model contains, namely that it's now essentially impossible for new people to get invested in Destiny as a franchise.\n\nOld content has been vaulted away, never to be seen again. This includes but is not limited to the original campaign that this game was offering as it's primary story (of which future content would build upon rather than replace). The story of Destiny 2 is unplayable within Destiny 2, all that remains are DLCs priced the same as full installments for AAA releases.\n\nLightfall was particulary dissapointing, but arguably the decline began in Shadowkeep, and even the original Red War campaign was never that good. The game is fundamentally a grind-fest, not to mention the numerous arbitrary limitations on resources and currencies to make that grind as painful and tedious as possible.\n\nHarder content that most dedicated players would say is the point of playing the game, like Raids and Dungeons, is either locked behind a seemingly endless line of filler content pretending to be story, or is locked behind a completely arbitrary power cap that is constantly increasing due to rampant power creep.\n\nI could go on but I don't need to.\nI will still continue to play this game, purely out of my sunk-cost fallacy.\nBungie, I liked you during the Halo days, but now you've turn sour.\n\nBring back ALL of the vaulted legacy content, remove all of the arbitrary limit on resources, and actually try to make a DLC campaign that does more than look nice and waste your time (and money). THEN, we'll talk.",

I never had the attitude that Bungie could do no wrong but I wanted to believe  they would continue to evolve the game and make it better. Lightfall launched and I felt like many, it was a huge disappointment and did little if nothing to evolve the franchise. I didn't even finish the campaign, and took a 2 week break from the game 2 weeks later, like someone in an abusive relationship, I decided to log back on and finish the campaign and other content I had paid 100 dollars for/ I was met with a message that said I was banned. This was very confusing to me seeing as I never used cheats or did anything I was aware of that was against T.o.s. There was no way to contact bungie  other than their terribly implemented forums. Upon submitting an appeal all I got in response was that the ban would not be overturned. They did not provide me with any reason as to why I was banned ( because there wasn't one ) . Myself and many others had thousands of hours of their time and over a thousand dollars of content  wrongly taken from them with no recourse and no explanation. I never thought i would say this but because of this i feel bungie is more predatory than activision/ blizzard  in this manner because even they would not issue a permaband with no explanation.\n\nTLDR\nDo not play this game unless you wish to have thousands of hours and dollars wrongly taken from you with no explanation why.Any one who gives a dime to this company is setting a dangerous precedent that gaming developers do not have to be accountable to the players who support them. If you're looking for a good mmo experience there are plenty of much better mmos . The game had potential 5 years ago and it was squandered . Not only that but Bungies had decided to cannibalize their most loyal player in a lukewarm attempt to be perceived as doing something to fix the many broken aspects of the game. I don't thing disappointed even sums up how i and many other feel about bungie,\n",

I dislike the game's business practices since they infringe on the gameplay and loot available. It's extremely repetitive on the seasonal level as Destiny attempts to be a game you give ALL your time to and its the same thing...every season...Play this game as much as you want but just know that all Bungie's hard work goes to their micro transaction store instead of game play. Save yourself countless hours. The grinds are not worth the highs in comparison to lows. Enjoy as you will I spent like 700 bucks on expansions and dlcs combines since all the days of D1. This game is FPS league of legends. Dont let your friends play it\n",

            "review": "Don't think I've ever played a fun, exciting game like this that actively suffers from timed content in such a prolific way. There are so many builds that rely on certain weapons that you can't obtain anymore. I'm a returning player who skipped all of Beyond Light Launch and onward until Lightfall, and god it is just so painful to see a cool build or a build that is *required* for some sub-classes to even function well in any meaningful content... And have the weapon that makes the build work require a catalyst that is now a random drop, or you can't even get anymore if you tried. Seasonal weapons have done a great job as the game's life as gone on to address pain points of boring loot and weak rolls, but now a player who has missed even just one season can be behind forever... Now there *are* ways for these weapons to 'come back'. With set rolls on vendors, at random completely indiscernible times for a week at most. I waited for a Calus Mini Tool SMG with demolition and/or Incandescent to be available all the first two seasons of Lightfall for my solar builds (builds that are now much weaker due to season of the deep's mods)... And it just hasn't reappeared. I had to settle for a much less effective weapon and weapon type I could craft just to function on my solar builds. This pattern is repeated with Arc builds this season, where my Thunderlord hasn't gotten a catalyst to drop and I have no good primary/special weapons for arc to use.\n\nDestiny is super fun, really! It's extremely exciting, the effects are all top-notch, enemy design is varied and there is alot of challenging raids and content... But, back when I was playing the game years ago, we didn't have to buy dungeons. We paid less for expansions and seasons, and retained the same amount of content. Now, not only has these been brought up in price, and dungeons now being sold separately from the normal game... Bungie are making more money every year then last. They are making two more brand new games, one of which was just announced. They are not doing this, nickle and diming every last piece of content, to make the game. They are doing it to make a profit. So, as such, these problems amount to alot of frustration. For now, unless you've been playing this game since it started or years prior to this review, avoid at all costs. It's not worth it, period.",

You’ll find more about online in the detailed section of this review down below;\n❌ (IMPORTANT) you don’t want to have a Rockstar account which is active and online while you’re playing as it’s mandatory;\n\nVerdict: 9 \n\nTime required to finish the single player game campaign: 30 hours \nTime required to complete it at 100%: 200/250 hours (took me 250 including online achievements)\n\nLonger version:\n\n[b]a) realistic and historical american environment [/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972922065\n\nRDR2 takes place by the end of the 19th century, in an imaginary area that could be generally summarized as a mix of Louisiana, New Mexico and Nebraska (or any other US state filled with a mountain type of environment).This excellent mix of different biomes is filled with hundreds of animals of all species; fauna itself is “real” in the sense that their behaviour and daily (and nocturnal) life are well represented and very close to reality (i.e. you’ll see owls flying into the night mostly, different temperatures etc…). You’ll really feel like living in a beautiful yet hazardous country, enhancing even more the immersion and the narration.\n\nAnother great touch of realistic fauna: when hunting animals, different weapons and ammunition, along with the animals’ body parts that will be hurt will lead to different results when hunting, for example shooting a rabbit with a shotgun will destroy the carcass, while using a bow with a precise shot or headshotting it with a low calibre rifle will allow you to skin the animal properly and get a higher quality pelt and more edible meat quantity.\n\nFunny side note: horses will p00p. A lot. Often. Consider yourself warned.\n\n\n[b] b) Clothes, voice acting and face cameras:[/b]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972367589\nGiven how accurate and detailed the clothing (of all kinds, even the pijamas!) is (and not only that) the immersion is made much deeper, thanks also for the countless hours spent by the developers’ team and the actors/actresses while animating the characters while in game and during the cinematic cutscenes;\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972965029\n\n[b]c)\tNarration and gameplay: (dis)honorable choices and (grey) remarkable characters:[/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972612738\n\nRDR2 has a “honor bar” system, which goes up when helping people, being honest or being merciful and goes down while being the opposite, impacting both how NPC perceive you, in part how the game will end and how your companions and surroundings will interact with you; all the characters…are quite remarkable and deep, the whole roster of people have all their own story and background, even those who don’t see much screentime or play an important role in the story…it’s almost impossible to not be or become somewhat fond of them or even not remotely interested in their stories and epilogues.\n\nThe narration is extremely fluent and hits hard thanks also to its main protagonist - Arthur Morgan – which is one of the best fictional video games characters I’ve ever seen in my experience due to his versatility, his falsely crass (yet extremely fun at times) attitude, his sarcastic comebacks and his overall growth, in every aspect.\n\n\n[b]d) Red Dead Online, few important points to mention :[/b]\n\nThis game mode is set up in the same world that you’ve spent your single player campaign, sadly whether you’re going to play to get the online achievements only or to just enjoy it for the sake of it, my advice is to buy some online currency and unlock two specific roles (collector and bounty hunter) to be over with the online as quickly as possible. To be more clear and specific:\n\n1- there are microtransactions, worsened by the fact that the cost of each item on online mode is multiplied excessively in comparison to its single player counterpart;\n2- is it possible to farm online currency with daily and weekly activities but in a really slow pace, which really doesn't go well with the nature of RDR2 online which allows for free roaming, but becomes chaotic pretty quickly;\n3- there are many griefers and cheaters on online servers, which can slow your progress, even though changing servers usually gets your rid of those annoying people;\n4- the online gamemode could have seen some more love, sadly GTA online was/is too profitable to be put away in favor of this one, probably harder to be managed/modded and rectrated due to its historical setting;\n5- as soon as you'll join online mode you'll be swarmed and overwhelmed by ingame messages,tutorials, tips and quests, making the learning curve quite brutal. I'd recommend playing 5-10 hours of single player campaign before going online;\n6- most of the fun online is made by roles, which are \"licenses\" which will unlock you key rewards, new activities and game modes. Sadly those are behing a paywall, literally. \n7- some online items (example: clothes, horses and equipment items) aren't into single player mode, which is a shame, but this happens when the online experience isn't as well thought of as the single player one;\n\n\nThanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night, feel free to follow my other reviews at: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32344423/",

This game is an absolute masterpiece and one of the best games I have ever played. The attention to detail in this game is incredible. I could spend hours wandering around the wilderness admiring it's atmosphere. The campaign is one of the best adventures I have ever experienced.

[b][i] Do note that I don't usually write a review or make an essay out of it but this game deserve one!. [/i][/b] The game itself is very immersive probably one of the best I've experienced. The landscapes are awe-inspiring, from the rugged mountains to the rolling plains, each with its own distinct atmosphere and beauty. The attention to detail is staggering, with dynamic weather and realistic animal behavior breathing life into the surroundings. It's a world that basically begs players to explore.\n\n[b] Development [/b]\nThe greatest thing R2D2 have to offer is the deeply engrossing character development of Arthur Morgan. As a member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur is a complex protagonist with a troubled past and a conflicted moral compass. Through the course of the game, players witness his transformation from a loyal outlaw blindly following his leader to a man questioning his actions and searching for redemption. The writing and voice acting are exceptional, capturing the nuances of Arthur's personality and emotional growth.\n\n[b] World Immersion[/b]\nThe open world is filled with diverse missions, side quests, and activities that complement the overarching story. Whether engaging in intense shootouts (as always~), doing heists, or simply exploring the wilderness, the gameplay remains consistently captivating. I have over 70+ hours now and I haven't even complete my first playthrough (due to exploring the map, side-activities and irl education/work). With all that, there are still things which I have yet too discover! Like who is Gavin??!\n\n[b] TRY IT! [/b]\nWhether you're drawn to the allure of the Wild West or simply appreciate a masterfully story driven game, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute must-play. While writing this down I should also note that Arthur Morgan is hands down the best protagonist out there!<3\n\n왜 아직도 읽고 있니? 이미 구입!\n그리고 모두 즐겁게~~",

            "review": "[h3]Now THIS is how to tell a story.[/h3]\nRed Dead Redemption 2 features the most gripping narrative I’ve ever seen in a video game. The epic journey of Dutch Van der Linde's gang of outlaws is full of so many jaw-dropping, cinematic, action-packed moments, but still stays believable as the protagonist Arthur Morgan slowly frees himself of his life-long gunslinger ideals. And every character in the Van der Linde gang’s saga feels remarkably human, thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting that perfectly complement this game’s stunning visuals, detailed animation and beautiful music.\n\nAll of these elements combine to make the world of Red Dead 2 come alive in a way that no other open world game does. The massive five-state map is incredibly dynamic, with missions, side quests and random events of equally high quality perfectly interwoven into an enchanting world that constantly changes with the flow of the main story. And there are so many little details throughout this game - from memorable NPCs to colorful customization options to fleshed-out minigames - that make the experience feel authentic.\n\nEven though I absolutely loved the phenomenal story and atmospheric world of Red Dead 2, the gameplay mechanics can seem shallow when taken out of context. Granted, there’s nothing wrong with the core controls - the shootouts are fun even on controller thanks to the Deadeye time-slowdown ability, and riding around on a horse is simple but satisfying. However, responsive controls are sometimes de-emphasized in favor of handholding gameplay and \"realism\" in regard to difficulty and mission structure. Horses automatically steer themselves on rough terrain, animations make looting and crafting take longer, many missions include trailing sections so the player can get where they need to go… et cetera.\n\nUsually, when a game prioritizes realism over immediate gameplay like this, there’s a weak link somewhere that breaks my immersion - such as bad voice acting, weak writing, faults in sound design or visuals, or spacing of content around the map. And this usually results in these “realistic” game mechanics becoming more tedious than they are immersive, distancing me from whatever atmosphere is trying to be established. But.. this isn’t the case with Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\n[h3]Red Dead 2 might be the first game to [i]fully convince[/i] me of its own world's authenticity.[/h3]\nThe immaculately detailed world and unbelievably human characters of RDR2 breathe life into in-game tasks that I would normally consider boring, like trailing missions, herding animals and catching fish - making even these less inspired gameplay segments pretty damn fun. The gameplay mechanics aren’t untouchable on their own, but the sixty-hour-long story pretty much is, and it’s paired with an intricate portrayal of 1899 America that makes the narrative just as enthralling as some of the greatest movies and TV shows ever made. This commitment to realism and thorough storytelling makes even the slower paced segments of the game exciting, and the intense parts (like shootouts) more meaningful.\n\nI’m already partway through my second playthrough now, and I’m having even more fun this time around trying to dissect the incredible character dynamics and details of the open world now that I’ve beaten the game already. The more I play Red Dead 2, the more fascinated I am with the spectacular story and cast of characters - and the few issues I originally had with the mechanics have become less and less noticeable in the grand scheme of RDR2’s monumental scope. Rockstar has created a true masterpiece here, and the gripping tale of outlaw Arthur Morgan is a story I’ll never forget. 10/10",

I loved and enjoyed every second within the game, however getting it to run itself seems to be an issue. So after having tried everything to fix it, including asking Rockstar support for help and Steam, there is effectively no means of getting the game to run anymore. Like I said, i love it, but good luck getting it to work\n\nif anyone knows a fix i'd love to hear it! so far i've tried:\nreinstalling game \nreinstalling launcher\nclearing download cache in steam\nclearing launch data in rockstar launcher\nreinstalling graphics drivers\nupdating windows to newest update\nchanging settings file to DX12\nDeleting settings file",

            "review": "[h1] \"Look upon my works, foul creatures, and weep at its magnificence.” [/h1]\n\nSystem Shock represents a first-person shooter (FPS) game with emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving, originally developed by the company LookingGlass Technologies and published by the company Origin Systems in 1994. \nThis remake (2023) has been developed by Nightdive Studios and published by Prime Matter. Further notable remakes / remasters of the development studio are System Shock: Enhanced Edition (2015), Blood: Fresh Supply (2019), and Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition (2022).\n\n[i] Pros & cons: [/i]\n\n++ The station feels and looks like a real place. Every corridor offers aspects to explore, audio logs to listen to, and occasionally secrets to find. Some of the items can even be manipulated to your advantage, just try to drop a monitor on an enemy, or switch off the lights to gain the upper hand in a stealthy maneuver. All these factors ensure that the player is constantly entertained and at the same time looks over his shoulder; a wonderfully immersive combination.\n\n++ I just love the fact that this game demands attention from the player; such a refreshing challenge. No quest marker, no journal, just you and a piece of paper.\n\n+ The little mechanic about vaporizing junk items, to recycle them and gain cash, hits my hoarder mentality / advanced gamer OCD right on target. By now, I have abandoned my main quest and dedicated my humble being to the holy crusade to collect every junk item on the station. The sacred recycler demands its sacrifices!\n\no I already rue my choice of level 3 puzzles. They. Hurt. My. Brain. Dear reader, if you are interested in a less painful encounter with panels that will test your mental capacities (to the utmost degree), I strongly advice you select level 1 puzzles at the beginning of the game. You have been warned, hacker.\n\n- There are some dark sections in the original, and by that I mean pitch-black corridors, which add to the uneasiness. This title has the ‘better’ lighting, which I view a missed opportunity to enhance the horror factor of the overall experience. \n\n[i] Summary: [/i]\n\nHow I missed it to wander around in confusion on a maze-like space station overrun by androids and mutants, while an artificial intelligence conjures up my untimely demise and delights in my clumsy progress. I consider this an excellent remake and a masterclass in atmospheric immersion.\n\nRecommended for connoisseurs of faithful adaptations, and gamers with a hoarding disorder.",

There are many improvements over the original but there are also some tideous aspects of it that carried over, but to be fair, without those it wouldn't be Shock as we know it. Some creative liberties were taken with the remake some for better, some for worse but in general it balances out pretty well. The gameplay loop is spot on. It really feels like a Shock game.\n\n[h1]Details[/h1]\nThere's a new scrapping system. You can vaporize junk (anything that's not weapons, ammo, consumable items or key story items) and turn them into little scrap cubes that you feed to a recycler to get money. Smells like Prey to me but a cheap Wallmart knockoff of it, but that's fine. It can help you out if you need a few extra bullets. They also added a cargo lift so you can transport items from deck to deck. Think of it like the storage box in the Resident Evil games. When it comes to inventory managment, its the good ol grid. If you can fit it, you can have it. You can also find inventory expansions which is a great design decision honestly. Exploration also seems to be as equally rewarding as in the original. As much as the game is dumbed down compared to the original it makes it up by bringing a lot of new stuff in.\n\n[h1]My gripes with it[/h1]\nBoth classic games had a banger soundtrack both ambient and techno rave. It's honestly written in their DNA due to how iconic some of these were such as MedSci and Hydroponics of SS2 and Executive and Reactor of SS1. It's a shame to see that they decided to not include some of these bangers in the game. The ambient music is often drawn out by eeire noises which kinda sucks. The Reactor deck in this reboot honestly has a great remix of the original Reactor keeping both the song's identity while appealing to the new more atmopshe oriented vision of the game.\nOne last thing, the guns. Well not the guns themselves but how they interact wit enemies. The enemies upon dying just ragdoll in a silly manner like it's GMod.\n\n[h1]Is it worth the price?[/h1]\nI'd say wait for a sale. It's a pretty good game that knows the target audience well but 40 euros seems like a bit of an overkill.\n\n[h1]A list of bugs and issues for Nightdive to fix[/h1]\n- Gibs are really unoptimized and drop the otherwise fine framerate severely.\n- Pressing backspace in the log transcript doesn't bring you out of a log menu.\n- The combat music plays even when it really shouldn't.\n- The front hand is not gripping the shotgun properly",

The puzzles are not hand holding though so be careful to pay attention to those messages if you want to make progress through floors but if that isn't your thing you can actually turn the plot difficulty down!

The controls are fluid and responsive, while the AI has also been improved to create a more immersive experience. The UI is cleaner and easier to use than the original game, and the sound design is equally impressive. The atmosphere in the game is intense and atmospheric, with a haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements it.

It's a relic from the past, from the good old days of gaming, where games were made to entertain the players. Back then games were usually hard on default and did not have the handholding modern games do. No regenerating HP, waypoint indicator and in a lot of cases no autosave/checkpoint system. You had to figure out everything yourself (or get a guide lulz).\n\nNow if you have some nice memories from the good times or are a fan of the original System Shock series, this game is made for you. You'll love it, guaranteed. On the other hand, if you are part of the new generation, this can be your entry to the reliquary. It's a game with modern graphics, with some quality of life changes, but old game rules. A really carefully made remake of a titan of its time. Check out the demo first, you  have nothing to lose.\n\nAs I've already mentioned, the game is really faithful to the original game. It clearly shows the devs love towards it. Even the new additions to the remake are very carefully crafted and feels like they've been part of the 1994 classic from the start. Not to mention it's well optimised. A phenomenal job indeed.\n\nSure there are some caveats, like not much ambient background music (Why tho?) and some minor bugs. Like I have to disconnect my gamepad when playing this game because it's always pressing the right button on the menus and it's fking annoying. Some key rebinding issues etc. I'm sure these will get fixed pretty soon. Also DLSS is in the game, but no FSR (again, why tho?) or HDR (the demo had HDR even if it was broken and the game would look fantastic with it, fix it my dudes instead of dropping it from the game).\n\nMan, I wish you guys were the ones making duke nukem forever. I'm sure it would have turned out differently.",

            "review": "★★★★☆ Very Good!\n\n[h1]Action[/h1]\n\nIt's by far the best way to experience a classic and understand why it's such a classic. Modern games have taught us that the developers will make sure that we do not get lost in their game and constantly present everything on a silver platter. This game won't hold your hand. It's up to you to navigate and fight through it. It may not appeal to everyone, but giving it a try is a must, as it is a very influential game and the granddaddy of its entire genre (Thief, Deus Ex, Bioshock, Dishonored, Prey 2017) \n\nI forgot when was the last time I felt in the game that I was not led by the hand, but really given food for thought and space for experiments.\n\nFor those who are going to try this remake, I will only say one thing: give the game a chance, let it rock a little, because the first 2 hours of gameplay can be very confusing. I would call it a period of adaptation to a non-standard gaming experience, which not every modern game can let you experience.\n\nOverall, I am highly satisfied with what Nightdive accomplished and I can recommend the Remake.",

            "review": "This game sat in my Steam Wishlist for about 6 years. There were times when I thought it was never going to be released. Now that I have played it a little I have to say that it was well worth the wait. I played the original System Shock back in the 90s and it remains one of the best games I have ever played. That game was well ahead of its time with lots of little things that gamers take for granted now. For example, it was the first game I ever remember playing with a \"lean around corners\" feature. Now, all these years later, it's very clear to me that this remake was a labor of love for the developers. I am really enjoying the game. The visuals are good, but retain the feel of the original game. The soundtrack is really good; very cyberpunky, techno, and creepy. I am so glad that the devs, while upgrading the visual and audio technology, decided to leave overall gameplay mechanics of the original game in tact. The game does no hand-holding. You are in a huge, yet claustrophobic, enviromment, with a HUD map and compass, but there are no \"quest markers\" to show you where to go or what to do next. You simply have emails and audio recordings from the dead crew of the space station you are on to give you info and clues in an in-world narrative way--passwords, objectives, locations of ammo and supplies, etc. I admit that some modern day gamers with little patience may have trouble sticking out out with this game, but from my perspective, it adds to the immersion of the experience. I am enjoying the circuit breaker puzzles for opening doors and taking down shields, and the couple of times I have \"jacked\" into cyberspace have been pretty enjoyable. I like how the visually protrayed cyberspace in the game, again with modern tech, but the old school aesthetics. I'm only a fraction of the way through the game, but I am guessing this will end up being my favorite game of 2023. If you've played any of the Bioshock games and enjoyed them, but never played the original System Shock, you owe it to yourself to play this progenitor of those games.",

I think this is exactly that.\n\nThe idea of some rando coming into my single player game and forcing me to change my preferred slow and methodical gameplay style seemed like a terrible idea. The cool thing about the invasion mechanic is you can set it to friends only, or turn it off entirely. That's what I did for my first playthrough of the campaign. I had a blast. The invasion mechanic is actually really cool if you want to play through the game again. I'm in the process of getting all the achievements and medals currently. It's fun to have others turn up in my game and give me some fun PvP interactions. It's also to load into someone else's game and try and slowly hunt them down. The 4 person survival modes are a ton of fun. They really bring out the fun in using some of the secondaries provided. My campaign playthrough was mostly rifle for distance, pistol for close quarters. Survival was the SMG's and shotguns time to shine. I don't really have an opinion on multiplayer matches, I've not really played much of any of the game modes. I'm currently playing through the campaign again with a friend in co-op and it's a lot of fun. Something I really appreciate is the ability to switch to first person view on all guns. That's my preferred way to play.\n\nNot much of a groundbreaking review to be fair. I liked the previous games, I liked this one with invasions turned off. I liked playing again with invasions turned on. I liked doing the invasions myself. I recommend it.",

If you can start the game at all (lots of reports that people can't), and if you play without crashing (lots of people complaining about crashes), and if you can put up with bugs that are being \"looked into\" for months, and if you can run the game long enough for memory leaks not to send you crashing, then you can play.\n\nSurvival mode is a disappointment, lacks the luster SE4 had for replayability, and has coding issues where sometimes poor spawns or out-of-bounds vehicles end your game.  Also too few maps.\n\nThe maps are beautiful in most cases, but there is repetition (designer laziness) in some of them and you are not as free as you'd like to be.\n\nWind effects do not compare with SE4 unfortunately, and also there is no authentic plus mode, both of which make the game less challenging than most would welcome.\n\nWeapon modifications are too complex and silly, too overdone.  And some weapons that should appear do not.\n\nThe game is geared towards console warriors, and the game is cross-platform.  PC Steam users do not get the attention of the developers in the forums.  The most you will get is some lame acknowledgement (sometimes, not the majority of time either) that they read the issue, then you get told to contact support, who does nothing in most cases.\n\nUpdates are still 40 GB and up, all the time.  \"We are working on it\"\n\nMost maps are not sniper-generous.\n\nI enjoyed the single player campaign, but replayability is not as good as SE4.  If you play multiplayer, be prepared for a host of cheaters and disappointments there, IMO mostly because of all the console action that is now in the game.",

Lots of attention to details.\n- Sniper rifles have a new distance based aiming mechanic. Still it's a far cry from what Sniper Contracts offers.\n\nCons:\n- Plastic faces. I've never seen so bad faces in a AAA title. Crysis from 2007 looked better.\n- Horrible terrible stupid AI. I'm playing on authentic and it's just not there. AI won't see you when you're right in front of it. AI will however spot you when you're crouching 50 meters away.\n- Not a lot of new stuff if any in comparison to previous installments.\n- IRL something that's guarded is guarded at all times. Without ifs. That means it's ridiculous that you can sneak in almost everywhere without being spotted.\n- I can pick up a fourth gun which is the same as mine but with better modifications or the one which is not yet available, why? I can use it. If I switch to my own primary three guns, this fourth gun is dropped. What the hell? Found modifications are not unlocked by picking better guns.\n- Enemies popping out of thin air. This happens e.g. when you destroy objects and you have enemies \"sleeping\".\n- Not enough traversal freedom. Too many areas of the game are blocked seemingly for no reasons.\n\nBuy only when it's on sale.",

I also feel like the story wasn't as good as sniper elite 4 it's still worth it for the gameplay in my opinion. They added a few new features which surprised me but in a good way for instance they removed the golden skins and replaced them with camo varients which are unlockable by finding a workbench or achieving a specific amount of kills. One of the things i like alot about this franchise are the unique maps they out did themselfs definitly an improvement from their latest release the vr version which i assume has smaller maps because of the vr technology not being great yet. \nConclusion you shouldn't buy it for the story/graphics but for the gameplay.",
