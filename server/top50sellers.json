            "review": "As a big fan of survival games, Rust is definitely one of my favorite games.  It offers a unique blend of intense PvP combat, resource gathering, base building, and a persistent open world that constantly challenges your survival skills.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around survival and interaction with other players. Starting with nothing but a rock and a torch, you must scavenge for resources, build shelter, hunt for food, and defend yourself against the hostile environment and other players. The game's emphasis on player interaction adds a unique dynamic to the experience. You can form alliances, trade goods, or engage in brutal battles for territory and resources. The unpredictability of encounters with other players keeps you on edge, as you never know whether someone will offer assistance or pose a threat.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Rust is not without its flaws. The game has a steep learning curve, which can be overwhelming for new players. The lack of tutorials or guidance can make the initial experience frustrating and confusing. Additionally, the community can be hostile at times, with griefers and toxic players disrupting the gameplay. It's advisable to find a reliable group of friends or join a community server to enhance your enjoyment and mitigate these issues.  Rust is not a game for those seeking a casual experience. The game demands a significant time investment and rewards those who are willing to dedicate themselves to its demanding gameplay loop. Sometimes can be so addictive, affecting your own lifestyle and sometimes even your mental health, so be careful when you fall into the deep waters.\n\nDespite its flaws, Rust remains a must-play for survival game enthusiasts. Its intense gameplay, immersive world, and intricate mechanics create an addictive experience that keeps players coming back for more. Whether you're a lone wolf looking for a challenge or prefer teaming up with friends to conquer the unforgiving landscape.",

            "review": "The game is fun until you have invested hours upgrading your base and playing as a solo gamer gathering resources, sneaking around, and just trying to see what you can build. Then you have to log off to enter reality only to come back to find your base completely destroyed and no trace left. As you walk around just chopping trees and mining rocks living a peaceful life you get shot down by a player with a machine gun. This game would be good if it wasn't full of toxic players who only find joy in killing everyone. They cheated their way to the top by killing innocent players and naked men/women. Rust is where you go to meet the degenerates of society who would love if we lived in a world where they could kill with no regard or punishment. There needs to be incentive to players who want to not play GTA or provide help to players. I once gave someone resources and they literally shot me down because they wanted my axe and pickaxe. Which had they asked me to build one for them I would have.",

I spent a few wipes only farming sulfer to not go on a single raid and the ones i went on insta fail raid. One wipe i did inside SMG but not really. I also fell victim to bandicamp.com and threw my life saving away watching a streamer do it for free. Im broke sad mad angry on the edge. After today i uninstalled the game the only way i would ever reccomend this game is if u truly do not value ur time on this earth. u will be sucked and u wont ever ever ever be able to quit this game. Highly addicitive and stress.  since playing rust ive gained high blood pressure issues cant spell properlee. and no longer have any real life freinds. my clan has failed me. my leader failed me. but at the end of the day it is night. and i dont think i will ever play rust again. i also lost my duo bite two  4 months ago because he was mad i played with smg now i never will see him again on moose med",

I have found that my alcohol addiction has calmed down (not really) along with the beer bottles being broken on the floor from me absolutely dogging on my children after dying to a 11 year old racist door camper that calls me sh*t at the game. I could keep going about how rust made my life great but I wont, for now.\n\n#RustLife! 10/10 would recommend!!!!",

But with the modern control scheme SF6 offers, I can not only play, but [i]win against online players[/i] for the first time. It's like skipping straight past the entry barrier of learning inputs and getting straight on to learning fundamentals. I've heard all sorts of discourse about modern controls and how it breaks the meta if people can instantly input this or that, but I'm having a lot of fun thanks to it.",

            "review": "Street Fighter 6 is not only Capcom getting back in the saddle as part of the pantheon of fighting games makers, it's an evolution of the genre as a whole.\n\nIf you have even the slightest interest in fighting games this is a must buy. The game is bursting with beginner friendly tutorials that can either be simple instructions or deep, precise, dives into frames and advantage states and such, including a deep selection of tutorials and challenges for each character to help you fully grasp them. Each character feels distinct too, they may have overlapping general 'niche' roles but nobody feels 'surplus' or 'padded'. Manon and Zangief may be both grapplers, but Manon's slow build momentum focus is a world apart from Big Z's brutal command grab heavy arsenal of unrelenting high risk high reward offense.\n\nMultiplayer is smooth and easy, able to be accessed from both the fantastic hub world full of fun details or just from the main menu if you want to jump right in, and provides plenty of chances to learn your way up the rankings before being thrown in with the pros.\n\nThe option to switch between classic and 'modern' controls is great as well. Modern in no way feels like 'easy mode' or some crutch either, you sacrifice complexity for ease, and it's up to you to decide if easier supers and combos is worth losing some of the granularity of full control over your character's inputs. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' control system and you'll be matched with both types online, it's a preference issue rather than anything else.\n\nSingleplayer is equally well thought out, though. Arcade mode gives nice simple fights to explore a character and good story rewards, but the real star is it's massive World Tour mode where you make your own avatar to travel the world of Street Fighter meeting mentors and learning their styles. The overall story is fairly bland but the real draw is getting to find Chun-Li in Chinatown and get her to train you and building a relationship with her as a mentor to the point where you're texting with her randomly in the world and learning about what she's been up to since the past games as well as mastering her iconic moves.\n\nThat's a detail that seems to go overlooked at times, this is the first SF game in ages to move the story forward. Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, they've all progressed as characters and have experiences to share instead of being the same rather flat characters we've seen for decades at this point. It feels like a proper 'passing of the torch' in some ways too, there's likely to never be a SF game without the 'core' cast like Ryu but the story lets the new blood feel like genuine up and coming street fighters to watch out for rather than just random additions.\n\nThis is the Street Fighter most of us have been waiting ages for, and if you have even a passing interest in fighting games this is going to be a fantastic one to learn on.",

            "review": "Enjoyable but flawed. This game fell short of being something incredible.\nI don't believe I'm one of many with this perception of Hogwarts Legacy but it may prove interesting to some nonetheless.\nLong review below:\n\nThe Good:\n+ It's a nice visual game, some parts of it look \"magical\" indeed.\n+ The gameplay works and functions well from start to finish.\n+ The story has a few interesting moments but nothing that will blow you away. There won't be anything you won't see coming.\n+ The spells feel great, combat was one of my favourites aspects of the game. The devs did their job right on this front.\n+ A magical adventure for Harry Potter fans, it IS the best of all Harry Potter games, really immersive in some parts, fun in others and an overall good game. All in all, your money won't be wasted here. There's plenty of content to go around for everyone.\n+ Soundtrack and sound in general is authentic to what the Wizarding world should be.\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's a shame that many RPGs  that are open world learned nothing from Skyrim, Witcher and Red Dead Redemption.\n\n- Everything is so scripted to the point of comedy. As a result of that, it won't take more than several hours to realise how bland and empty Hogwarts is.\nThe best way to describe this is by comparing it to the tv series: Westworld (for those who have seen it). You feel like you're really trying to role play in a fake world.\nThe same animations will play in the castle over and over, the same NPCs with the same lines.\nYou get to experience all yearly seasons but besides some changes in the castle and around it, the NPCs react to nothing. Their garbs won't change according to the weather - in fact, they're not even reacting to it.\n\n- Immersion breaking.\nWhen you go outside of the castle in summer, you'll spot two students playing a game. That's a very nice moment to see the NPCs have activities around the castle. However, you'll reach winter and the same students are playing the same game, in their same outfits outside in the courtyard even at night time. The same orchestra music that you first hear when you go across the hall will be playing throughout all seasons, through all day/night cycles. It goes from a wondrous, special moment to a tedious, run faster so it'll bother you less.\nFor an RPG, one of its priorities should be to establish or at least try to make something remotely natural for the NPCs to do. There's many more such situations but I won't go further into that.\n\n- Progression is tied to the main story.  You cannot interact with your dorm colleagues or anyone around the castle unless it's a quest or a silly side quest. The house you pick doesn't matter. You'll only get 1 quest per house and it'll vary the looks of your outfit. I chose Ravenclaw but was shown around by a Weasly. I was expecting to have someone from my own dorm to be my friend/guide to lead me through the castle. \n\n- Your choices in the game have no consequence. Cast incendio wherever you want because nobody will react to it.\n\n- I understand that the developers are trying so hard to be \"progressive\" but in their pursuit of fulfilling an agenda they made the setting of 1800s Scotland feel like 2023 woke Hollywood. You'll hear the name of \"Sirona\" and how special she is more times than you'll enter her tavern.\n\n- Enemies around the world: \nYou'd expect the \"Forbidden forest\" and \"any other place in the world\" to be somewhat different from each other since it's an RPG.\nThe enemies around the castle would be of a lower level while the forbidden forest would have tougher or more dangerous enemies. That's not the case.\nYou'll fight: humans, spiders, frogs, wolves, trolls, goblins and That's it. There won't be a special enemy type anywhere in this world.\n\n- No interesting side quests or random events. Hogwarts Legacy doesn't have a natural side quest in it. You're exploring and suddenly you come across something - well, kinda... Some merchant who needs his pet rescued or kill more poachers. That's all you'll get.\nThe motivation to do these menial side missions is even lower due to the interchangeably awful voice acting and writing. It feels like if it’s not the writing that’s off, it’s the acting and vice versa. I would say the acting isn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but the writing reaches lower echelon Bethesda more often than not.\n\n- The HUD is cluttered and breaks immersion.\n- No memorable characters besides Sebastian.\n- No matter the graphical settings, the game has issues around Hogwarts and especially Hogsmead. Lots of stuttering, textures loading in late, so on and so forth. It's got technical issues still as of June 2023.\n\nConclusion:\nDespite most of its flaws and shortcomings Hogwarts Legacy is a strong game that many people will grow fond of. \nIt does the main part right: gameplay, decent story, graphics and depicts the world of Harry Potter better than other harry potter games.\nI strongly believe it wouldn't have been as successful if it weren't for huge controversies or if it didn't have the Harry Potter theme around it.\n\nIt's a 7.8 / 10",

This is the first computer game I have ever played - because I am a potter fan. And WOW! I now have so much respect for people who work in the gaming industry. It takes so much attention to detail and professionalism to create a quality game like this. What is amazing about this game is there are so many different ways to play it - you can find whatever works for you. If you like combat - go fight some trolls. If you like treasure hunt - go explore the school grounds and the forbidden forest. If you like raising pets - go catch some fantastic beasts. If you like the story - just stand in the middle of the hallway and listen to student gossip. this game caters to EVERYONE. i love it. My only complaint would be if this game could be played with multiple players. e.g. I invite my friends to hang out at the library together - that would be awesome!!! This game is beautifully made. Good job to the gaming team who created this.",

            "review": "After more than two decades of waiting, we can finally step into the wizarding world. That statement alone might suffice as a review in itself, but I'm not one to keep things that brief, so let me delve deeper and elaborate.\n\nThe developers promised us a game in which we can explore a rich open world comprised of Hogwarts and its surroundings, stories and places that may not be actual Harry Potter canon, but they're about as close as it gets. They succeeded beautifully, managing to avoid the blatant kind of fan service bordering on distasteful. It would have been all too easy to land in that pitfall and create a story with an old, wise and mysterious Headmaster, a grumpy and unlikeable Potions teacher who turns out to be a good guy, a half-giant teaching Beasts class, etc., but the teachers you will meet here all feel original, their job the only thing they share with their modern-age successors. The world feels refreshingly unique and comfortably familiar at the same time. The aspects that resonate are those tied to Hogwarts' rich history, recreated with loving care - notable locations, houses, ghosts, portraits, and the like. But it stops there. You won't be bumping into a kid Dumbledore in this game, and that's a plus in my book.\n\nExploration in Hogwarts Legacy should be pure bliss through and through for any Harry Potter fan, from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade and the Highlands. Puzzles are also entertaining, although I had a frustrating experience when one of them bugged out and became unsolvable until I finally realized that and restarted the quest. Combat feels dynamic and fun despite being on the easy side - this was probably a deliberate choice to accommodate younger players as well as HP fans who may not be hardcore gamers. (That being said, the final boss fight is challenging, so you'll want to gear up before going there.) I recommend playing with a controller, as 16 combat spells can be easily assigned and used quickly with a little practice. They all have their specific merits but come with a hefty cooldown time, so as a result, you'll light up the battlefield with a nice variation of spells just like a real wizard would instead of spamming the same move over and over again, as it often happens in similar games that use a mana-based system. (I can't say how grateful I am to the developers for avoiding the concept of mana entirely, as it wouldn't fit in well with the HP canon.) After spending over 70 hours in the game, fights still feel epic and satisfying to me, despite being aware that there is no way I might lose. An extra difficulty level over Hard would be appreciated, perhaps in a future update.\n\nOn another positive note, the game is very kid-friendly. My five-year-old daughter frequently awaits her turn to take the controller and ride a mount or interact with the cute animals. My sons are a bit older, and they can play the whole game on their own.\n\nAll that being said, some people are apparently less than thrilled with the game, and I think I can understand their perspective. While walking the corridors of Hogwarts, students often chit-chat but there are no interactions with your character. On occasion, unique events unfold which are usually solved by a figure of authority, but the player is left without any role to play. It's more akin to watching a movie scene than being an active participant. These events could have been done differently to allow the main character to make a choice that could impact the outcome of the event and the future status of the same minor NPCs, much like we see in other RPGs.\n\nNow, on to the primary point of criticism: the story. The central plot is passable and the side quests thankfully involve some narrative unlike the \"kill/bring a number of whatevers\" type of quests often seen in other games when the writers run out of ideas. That alone is commendable given the sheer number of side quests. None of the characters come across as one-dimensional and each appears to carry a certain depth, but sadly, that depth often goes unexplored due to the storylines' simplicity.  There is no romance in the game (which I don't consider a drawback, as I always opt for romance-free playthroughs myself). Narrative-wise, you won't find anything here that lives up to the standards of the original Harry Potter books, but that was to be expected. Sebastian's side story stands out as both the darkest and the best one of them all, and was the only one that genuinely made me ponder over my choices. While it doesn't reach J. K. Rowling's heights, it does possess the quality of an above-average HP fan fiction. My only complaint is something I cannot explain without a spoiler (skip ahead to the last paragraph if you want to avoid it). There is a scene in which Sebastian suggests you use your unique ability to help his sister by removing her sense of pain. At this point in the story, the consequences are not known. This should have been explored further, giving you the chance to decide whether to do so, risking either the consequences or Sebastian's anger.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of Harry Potter, there is a high chance you'll appreciate Hogwarts Legacy. However, your enjoyment will also hinge on why you loved the HP books in the first place. If the plot twists and relatable character interactions were the only aspects you liked, you may find the game somewhat underwhelming. But if, like me, you were captivated by the intricate world-building and eagerly pieced together the functioning of the wizarding world from the clues the books provided - keeping tabs on spells, creatures, places, potions, historical events, etc. - then this game is definitely for you. Go on, fulfill your long-held dream and have a taste of student life at Hogwarts!",

But then you realize that there is almost zero role-play involved in this game - it's just going out and killing stuff. You can cast Unforgivable Curses at will in front of your peers and professors and nobody bats an eye. Having finished the main quest and a few side quests, I don't see any replay value or ever coming back to this game, so I guess I will have to play through Skyrim for the 26th time. Hopefully the sequels or related games will have the same world details, but actually make it so that your actions have consequences or the story remotely interesting.",

            "review": "This game feels like fanfic based on a Harry Potter movie by a talented but inexperienced child. Don't get me wrong - the game is alright, it just sets its own stakes pretty high and then can't keep up. \n\nTl;dr: [spoiler] there are almost no interesting puzzles, most content is just repeatable placeholder, no impact from your choices on a game plot, the battle system Is very promising yet frustratingly simplistic, and the story is so predictable and overdramatic that it starts to be annoying.\nThe graphics are great, though, and many minor animations are delightful. [/spoiler]\n\nThe graphics are excellent, the world is beautiful, and there are many-many minor effects that you'll totally love, such as small animations of beasts, spells effects, castle ruins, small villages and so on, but it fails to work as a whole. For most of your gameplay, you'll be flying on a broom or jumping by floo powder chimneys, solving hundreds of puzzles that are indistinguishable from each other. There are like 5 or 6 patterns for them, and they are straightforward, so you'll get bored of them after the first ten and all others will just be groundhog day all over again.\n\nThe plot is boring. Most characters are shallow, and all they do is tell you about their past or what you should do next. There are some interesting moments in the arc of Sebastian where characters are shown not as plywood for the plot, but that happens for a very brief moment in a long story. I do understand that WB tried to keep the game 13+ so it should not be complicated, but it felt like they wrote its plot for a five-year-old.\n\nYour decisions will not affect the plot or the world, except for some cosmetic stuff or situational voice lines of surrounding characters. And it would be fine if the game didn't try to present it to you like you're making some severe choice each time. Hell, you can [spoiler] learn and use all three UNFORGIVABLE curses, [/spoiler] and it won't change anything about your path in this game.\n\nAnd the most controversial part for me was the battle system. It has everything to be great, but with no auto-levelling, repeating enemies and their primitive battling algorithms, you are just clicking them to death, juggling three types of spells to break their colourful shields. Often enemies will stand before you and wait for you to bash them out of existence. I wanted a hard battle, but the game does nothing to challenge you in fights, even in hard mode.",

But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.\n\nWhat drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?\nWhen I look into the boundless depths of my own loneliness I see a pool of reflection. My face isn't there, there is no face. There are only tears in that pool, tears of shame and loss and confusion.\n\nIf it were up to me again I know I would purchase it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip through the countless window prompts so I can have a single morsel of pornographic images which are readily available online.\nYet, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I still chose to purchase this game and devote hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and just like the time I fear I may never find it again.\n\nThere is something broken within me, something that desires sensation beyond my reach, something that whimpers every single night with the knowledge that there is no true Princess, it is a merely an illusion.\nIn my pursuit to find meaning in this long life, I sought the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop up window on my computer.\n\nI am unsure what the moral of this review is, I am unsure about my place within the universe, all I know is that no amount of virtual girls can cure the vast rot that has overtaken me.",

            "review": "Neural Networks: \"CS:GO: A Timeless FPS Phenomenon\" 9/10\n\nIntroduction:\nCounter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has solidified its position as one of the most iconic and influential first-person shooters of all time. Released nearly a decade ago, it continues to captivate gamers worldwide with its strategic gameplay, competitive intensity, and relentless action. In this review, we delve into the elements that make CS:GO a timeless masterpiece in the world of gaming.\n\nGraphics and Visual Design:\nCS:GO may not boast cutting-edge graphics, but its visual design strikes a perfect balance between realism and accessibility. The maps are meticulously crafted, offering diverse settings ranging from sprawling urban landscapes to tightly confined interiors. While the character models may lack intricate details, their distinct silhouettes and animations enhance the tactical aspect of gameplay. Overall, the visuals effectively serve the game's purpose without compromising performance.\n\nGameplay Mechanics:\nThe gameplay mechanics in CS:GO are the heart and soul of the experience. The precise gunplay mechanics are a testament to the game's commitment to skill-based gameplay. Every shot fired requires discipline, as accuracy and recoil control are paramount. Mastering the weapon arsenal and understanding map layouts become essential components for success. The game's economy system adds an additional layer of strategy, forcing players to make crucial decisions about weapon purchases and utility usage. The intensity and satisfaction derived from clutch moments are unparalleled.\n\nCompetitive Depth:\nCS:GO thrives on its fiercely competitive ecosystem. Whether engaging in matchmaking or watching professional tournaments, the game's competitive scene is nothing short of electrifying. The depth of strategies, teamwork, and individual skill displayed at the highest level is awe-inspiring. The community's dedication to honing their craft and the constant updates from the developers ensure a dynamic meta that keeps the game fresh and engaging.\n\nEsports Influence:\nCS:GO's impact on the esports landscape cannot be overstated. It has become one of the pillars of competitive gaming, drawing massive crowds and offering enormous prize pools. The game's popularity has paved the way for legendary teams and iconic players to emerge, creating a legacy that will be remembered for years to come. The commitment from Valve to support the competitive scene has helped CS:GO maintain its status as a premier esport.\n\nCommunity and Social Interaction:\nCS:GO fosters a vibrant and passionate community that adds another dimension to the game. Whether teaming up with friends or engaging with strangers, the shared experiences and camaraderie forged in-game create lasting memories. The availability of community-created maps, skins, and mods allows players to customize their experience further. However, as with any online game, toxic behavior exists, and it's important to find a supportive group of players to fully enjoy the game.",

            "review": "The base of this game is solid. It's everything I've ever wanted from a Starship Troopers shooter. \n\nThe concept is simple. \"Here's a gun, there's some bugs... Kill 'em all!\"\n\nThe weapons and armor are accurate, the arachnid's look great and most importantly, it's an absolute shitshow from start to finish for each mission. The randomized objectives seem to keep things fresh, though in the long term, I think they'll have to add more, varying objectives to keep the players engaged, but for now, in early access it seems to fit really well. Each mission really feels like the battle scenes from the movies, where troopers are doing their damnedest to hold the line and stay together while giant alien bugs just throw themselves at you and your squad, trying to split everyone up. It's chaos in the best way possible and they've nailed the feel of what it's like to be a rough neck slugging it out on some god forsaken rock in the galactic boondocks.\n\nThe 16-player count on each server does wonders for the experience. Most co-op games cap it at 4 or 8 players if they're feeling frisky, but OWI decided to just go for the glory here and gave us a player-count of 16 Troopers. This may seem like a small thing, but the choice adds a lot of options for people with big groups of friends. On top of it, it adds to the cinematic chaos that is so iconic for the franchise. The game on normal and harder difficulties can really be a struggle at times, and it should be. The movies and lore make even the most basic, Arachnid enemies appear extremely dangerous, and while one or two won't give you much of a problem, if you get mobbed by 10 or more, you'd better be looking for an exit strategy, or hope to god that the cavalry  is coming to save your sorry, ape ass from the shit. But, even if you've planned poorly and your team is too far away, OWI made it fairly easy to get saved by a team member, who can resurrect you, and anyone can do this regardless of what class you choose or what squad you're in. It pushes the concept of teamwork without forcing it as, in my experience, everyone's looking to save someone at any point in time, even at great risk to their own lives. If you are unlucky enough to go down, and perish from your wounds, then you'll have the opportunity to respawn pretty quickly. You'll drop back in close to the action so you can immediately pick up where you left off at killing as many bugs as possible. The only exception to this is once the mission has finished, players must move to the extraction. At this point, respawns are disabled, which seems a little stressful, but as long as you stick with the group, you'll make it out just fine. If you do go down, your teammates can still pick you right back up, too as long as you don't die for realsies.\n\nThe base building is a bit clunky, and a bit unintuitive to start with, but it's simple enough that it's easy to figure out in just a couple of matches, and the construction portions of the missions really add some much needed complexity and variety to the experience. These sequences give players a breather and a chance to heal up, gather some ammo and figure out what role they want to play in the on-coming arachnid assault. Once the assault happens, players will have running around, fixing walls, finishing bunker construction and trying to keep each other alive. The tower defense aspect of the game is definitely a good addition, but I think it needs a few more things to round it out, like constructing manned turrets and traps for the bugs (other than the electrified walls.) It's simple, but it gets the job done for now. If we're talking long term, post-release though, this feature is going to have to be improved in a few ways.\n\nThe only major concern I have with the game so far is the performance. I'm not sure if the game doesn't manage assets right, or if there's a memory leak someplace, but every round I start with 120+fps and by the end of it, I'll be lucky to stay above 40 FPS, even as bugs die and we move away from the constructed base assets, the FPS is just in the gutter. The performance in every single match degrades to a point where I doubt that the game will be playable for people on older rigs. I have a lot of friends that love Starship Troopers as much as I do, but don't have cutting edge hardware. If OWI can't get the performance issues reigned in quickly enough, I think it could hurt the overall experience once it's out of early access and will definitely cause people to not buy, or refund the game if it cannot run smoothly on mid-grade, older hardware.\n\nAll-in-all, OWI has a good thing going withe Extermination so far. It would be cool to see a few other options added to the game as players level up, or even a few more classes. It would be really awesome to have something like a VIP objective, where a player plays a high-ranking official or psychic that has special abilities, but has to be protected from the swarm of baddies all trying to kill them. I'd also like to see a mission where teams can tactically nuke a brain bug, just like in the movies! I do see the current mission objectives becoming stale for players, even with the variable, randomized objectives, but if they continue to add stuff during and after Early Access, I can see this being one of my favorite group games to play with friends for at least the next year or more. Extermination nails what so many games based on films so often get wrong, it makes you feel like a Trooper and from all the people that I've played with yelling movie quotes and Role Playing as a grunt in the trenches, I'm here for all for it. There must be a lot of Starship Troopers fans over in OWI, because they seem to get what makes this experience so special.\n\n",

The first impression really puts you in the Battle of Klendathu, Velaka in this case, with a soundtrack that pays homage to the film. The memorable part of playing will always be the endgame where everyone needs to extract safely and respawning is disabled. Troopers scramble from their overrun makeshift base to the landing zone and do their best to revive or providing covering fire for their fellow comrades. A two minute timer ticks away while an onslaught of Arachnids make their way to the dropship and you see a few Heavy Troopers hunker down with their mobile bunkers and unload their MG's into a wall of bugs. Medics desperately running into the line of fire while praying their drone can revive a downed teammate and Assault Troopers trying their hardest to lay covering fire from above and below. It was chaos on another level and I haven't had this much fun since the modded Left 4 Dead servers that allowed 8v8 with buy options. \n\nThe game is definitely in Alpha stage, with only 2 playable game modes and 3 Classes to level up. Their equipment and weapons are limited but Medic seems to be the most versatile with mid to long range weapons(even a grenade launcher that clears up the field very well), extremely useful perks, and a great selection of grenade types to even the playing field. \n\nThe gunplay is ok, I find myself using the standard issue Morita MK.I rifle way more than anything else for that Starship Trooper Combat Scene feel. It has reliable damage and a decent 60 round clip, but the damage effect on bugs is minimal. You can see some bullet holes on the pinchers of the Arachnids but you don't feel the weight of how much damage you do to them. You also don't see a pile up of bugs while you shoot from a wall to really see the carnage your team is creating when defending. \n\nThere are plenty of bugs to kill and it does not get dull after 8 hours of play. You'll see plenty of Drones and Warrior Bugs, sprinkled with alittle bit of Gunner Bugs who are extremely dangerous if left alone. The real fight happens when a couple Plasma Bugs and Tiger Tank Arachnids appear that can soak up a ton of damage and dish it out to destroy your fortifications. I am hoping the developers add those flying bugs to really make things tense as it is!\n\nI will update this review with Cons in the future because right now I just havent experienced any real issues that have deterred me from playing or requesting a refund.",

It's going to be difficult for this game to survive with that requirement, unless it absolutely blows up. There need to be bots, difficulty scaling, and alternate game modes (solo, 1-4 player, and even an 8 player mode would be great) for this game to endure.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't say \"no\" to a wider range of guns, attachments, and a system for cosmetic armor pieces (I'd even take color schemes for the basic models). But that's late stage stuff, I know. More maps and modes, first.",

            "review": "TL;DR - A great game, but it has both good and bad decisions. Solid 7.5 - 8 / 10. Feels like an Arcade version of Monster Hunter.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis is the MOST grindy Monster Hunter game I have played, only bested by the JP only MMO Monster Hunter Frontier.\n\nHowever, there's a lot of cool ideas and there is still a lot of fun to be had. Such as the vertical movement, special attacks and if you get the Sunbreak Expansion, new basic combos for each weapon to change up your normal gameplay.\n\nThe mobility is awesome with both player movement and the new dog companion being a mount. The weapons feel slick and fast. Monsters are much more active and can be incredibly aggressive now.\n\nCombat feels awesome, especially when fighting regular monsters. Hits have good weight, each weapon has many options and it's a ton of fun to land some counterattack, or a big move and have the monster stumble and fall to your mighty blow. Or maybe you tapped it with your hand and it collapsed, either way the gameplay is still as solid as ever in any Monster Hunter Title.\n\nOn one hand, they're now more engaging, but on the other hand a lot of the monsters individual personalities feel lost. \n\nIf you're not a completionist, the game should give you about 60-100 hours with friends easily. If you're alone, your gameplay time may vary.\n\nThe endgame in Rise is mostly just fighting the same monsters you've already been fighting, but they have a titanic health pool instead of a normal one, and they hit REALLY hard. You're grinding for a specific material that only drops off this special version, but only about 2 or 3 each hunt. Then, once you grind that same monster enough, it gets stronger and now drops that same item, but STRONGER, and you have to grind that item too. It gets insanely repetitive and boring.\n\nAfter 100%-ing the game with my wife, I uh...I have a final statement.\n\nI have finally earned my freedom.",

It’s a simple concept that’s been used since the first monster hunter game and I think people don’t realize that games can have simple concepts and still be fun. You hunt monsters, you keep hunting monsters, it’s fun. The gameplay is easy but hard to master, love using the charge blade. My only gripe about this game is going from a magnificent feast from monster hunter world…..to just three sticks of dango and a cup of tea, and I get it, it’s a Japanese setting but they could’ve done some yakisona, takoyaki, onigiri and sake. Anyways the game is 10/10 and I thought a lot of the formula and features in world were useless so it’s nice seeing the game going back to the basics without the tracking quests just to report back just so the next time you go out you can actually fight the monster",

There is no requirement for 'You can only join the quest after the leader watched all cutscenes' anymore.\nMy only a little bit of complaint is how multiplayer works, instead of you can search the quest thats been requested SoS from (MH:World), you search based on target monster or which quest you want to join. So it's impossible to look at list of quest on quest board like in previous iteration.",

This is one of the best Marvel games to have ever come out and it was a true love letter to the Spider-Man fans. It was also a true achievement for the industry to accomplish since this game has so much heart put into it. This game also has a really fun and addictive game play style and has many content to explore throughout the game. Overall I would most certainly suggest this to anyone who is into any action games or is a fan of Marvel.",

This game is too short. I mean for almost the same price as Marvel's Spiderman, I finished all objectives in well around 26 hrs as compared to the 100+ hrs it took me for Spiderman.\n2. There needs to be some varieties of enemies and bosses. I feel like I only remember Prowler, Rhino and Tinkerer fights, but then again the first point kinda covers it.\n3. The venom and cloaking are awesomely done in this game, loved those abilities.\n4. Costumes are downright sick, better than the Spiderman ones' imo.\n5. Ran really well on Steam Deck (finished it on deck).\n\nIf this game had the same or almost similar amount of gameplay content as Spiderman, this would have been my favorite spiderman game yet.\n\nIac, this game is worth playing, maybe get it on sale coz original price ain't worth it.\n\n",

Don't end up making multiplayer games or do not get the idea of it, cause your gonna get greedy too like the rest of the game developers. Pls make games like these and i count on you for making marvel games. Right now i can't wait for the Wolverine and Spider-Man 2 game getting ported into PC.",

            "review": "Spider-Man: Miles Morales swings onto the scene, captivating fans with a thrilling and heartfelt adventure. Developed by Insomniac Games, this highly anticipated follow-up to the critically acclaimed Spider-Man game for PlayStation delivers an unforgettable experience that showcases the incredible powers and growth of Miles Morales as he embraces his role as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.\n\nSet in the snowy backdrop of a wintery New York City, the game immediately immerses you in its richly detailed and vibrant world. The visual enhancements and attention to detail on the PlayStation 5 are truly remarkable, with stunning graphics, fluid animations, and breathtaking lighting effects that bring the city to life. From the snowy rooftops to the bustling streets, every corner of the city feels alive and interactive, making exploration a joyous experience.\n\nMiles Morales takes center stage as the protagonist, and his character development shines throughout the game. As a mixed-race teenager grappling with the weight of responsibility, Miles's journey is not only about becoming a hero but also about finding his own identity. The writing beautifully explores themes of family, friendship, and the power of community. It's refreshing to see a superhero story that delves into the personal struggles and triumphs of its protagonist, creating a strong emotional connection between the player and Miles.\n\nThe gameplay in Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a seamless blend of acrobatic web-swinging, thrilling combat, and innovative new powers unique to Miles.

If that is your cup of tea.\n\nGood thing is you can play it however you want. The game can be easy or hard as you want it to be.\n\nOverall, the experience is like having a weird dream. I'm just glad that I finished it so I can move on to the next game.  It didn't give me any empty feeling after finishing the first playthrough unlike when I finished The Witcher 3. It's a great game but not the best game of the decade. It's just because other games at the moment are all shit.",

            "review": "TLDR down below.\n\nBest shooter roguelike out there.\n\nHas everything a modern roguelike should have: \n\n- Multiple characters that feel unique:\n Every character has multiple styles of play. You can focus on one of their 2 special abilities or on abilities that improve your weapons. But this is not required, you can use a bit of all 3 styles and still feel strong. Most characters gravitate to certain kinds of weapons with which they will probably do best. All characters have 3 trees of 6 power ups that you can pick from after you finish a stage.\n\n- a lot of different weapons to get:\nThere are over 50 weapons divided into 8 classes. Most weapons feel unique and have their own gimmick. You can carry up to 2 weapons making certain combo's is possible. A downside with such a big selection is of course that some weapons feel like weaker versions of others. Also each weapon being pretty unique means that some will not be suited to your style at all. \n\n- Permanent upgrades:\nThere is permanent progression between runs you can upgrade with a currency you get by playing. I know this goes against the definition of roguelike but all modern rogues have this feature. The devs can make harder/more fun encounters that feel unfair but get less unfair the more you invest in this system which ultimately makes the game better since they can push the boundaries the game. You can also go for an extra challenge by not/ partially investing in this to make it harder for yourself.\n\n- Difficulty settings:\n\nThere are 4 difficulties to play in. You are locked to normal at the start but unlock higher difficulties by beating the hardest difficulty you currently have. The 4th difficulty is the most unique, it features unique upgrades you can buy with the same currency used for the permanent upgrades (this means that currency is not useless when you unlocked the whole prema upgrades tree which is nice) which will change the way you play in a major way and is so much fun! The game never feels to unfair, you can win the game with any combination of weapons/power ups as long as you can keep dodging!\n\n- Many upgrades\nDuring the run you encounter these power ups called occult scrolls, they can straight up boost your damage/survivability or change the way you play. Some boost you in a big way but will also restrict you in a way, there is a lot of different 'builds' you can aim to go for.\n\n- 4 worlds to go through, with their own enemies to fight.\nThe enemies are cool, there is ranged and melee enemies. Some have unique mechanics that are not super hard to play around. Of course this gets harder when it's accompanied by other enemies. Enemies get harder in the later worlds, it's not uncommon to almost get oneshot there. The bosses of these areas are also very good. Huge monsters in their own arena with alot of different attacks that have to be dealt with, and somewhere in between you are supposed to actually kill them.\n\n- Active devs\nThe game still gets regular patches and updates, there is still a roadmap for their future content like in the beta. They have added new characters, bosses, a new world and a new game mode since beta. There is still more to come as well. When you encounter bugs in game there is a feedback option which you can access during your run and explain the bug. And you actually get listened to, every bug I have reported over the years has been fixed in a reasonable time frame, almost always in the next patch.\n\n- Good pricing\nThis game is 100% worth getting at full price. It is more then reasonable if you see the huge amount of content here that puts AAA games to shame. There has been 1 DLC so far which included 2 characters. So far it is the only content that is gated behind a DLC, their new game mode that could have been a DLC in itself was added completely free. If you are looking for a game like this I would just buy it now!\n\n- Multiplayer\nThe game supports multiplayer, there is a matchmaker to play with random people as well. I cannot comment on the quality of that since I never did that. I have only played multi with 1 friend and it was fun, every player gets their own weapon and scroll drops so nobody can 'steal' your upgrades like in Risk of Rain 2. If you don't need your drops you can press a button to make them visible for your allies so they can pick it up. You can help each other get to their preffered build faster but you can't get 'griefed' by people that steal your drops. I feel this is the best way to create a multiplayer experience in a co-op game. The new game mode can also be played with friends. \n\nTLDR:\nif you like this genre, you should definitely buy this. Big worlds, al lot of characters, weapons and power ups. Different difficulties for everyone, a multiplayer that is done extremely well for a co-op game. The devs should feel very proud of what they accomplished with this game. I look forward to the bright future of this game!\n\nThe game has this big \"one more run\" feel that every good roguelike should have.\n\nIf I have to put a number on it it's a 9,5/10 for me. I hope this review helped any people with doubts to make a good decision!",

            "review": "Meh, I want to like this game more but it's got a lot of problems for me personally. It's not bad, I enjoy it and play it with friends or on my own occasionally but everytime I do nowadays I just end up irked over one thing or another. I could probably recommend it if you like this sort of thing, but I'd like to list out my problems as someone that's played both a lot of shooters and roguelikes/lites.\n\nAlthough I'll start with the good, the gunplay and weapon designs are incredible and a ton of fun to mess with, reincarnation is incredible too, the wacky builds you can pull off at that point are a ton of fun. That's really the main positive here, and if that's good enough for you you'll probably love this. It's great for more casual play.\n\nThe problems start with the enemies, its not necessarily their attack patterns, their hp, or anything like that. They're well balanced, but for a few reasons they don't *feel* satisfying to fight. The way they move around is kind of awkward, rigid, and janky, its not smooth at all and feels random and just frustrating enough to lower the feel of combat for me. Its not bullshit or anything, but it makes it harder to enjoy the great gunplay and with enough playtime it became harder and harder for me to overlook.\n\nThe game has a lot of content, side modes and such that might seem like nice mixups at first but it all ends up being kinda mediocre and I just end up playing reincarnation instead. Spirtual Assault is still a complete mess, its not a bullet sponge hell-hole anymore but its just soooo boring and really highlights the unsatisfying enemy design. It needs to seriously be cut down and better paced, it goes on way too long for how mindless and spammy it is. The final boss for it is designed okay move-wise but is still annoyingly tanky and unfun to fight as a result.\n\nThe further you go into the game progression wise the more of a problem the stat system becomes.  It's much better to stick with one weapon early on with good affixes and pump all the money into it. Unless you're playing a character like the dog there's little reason to ever switch between two weapons, ammo is plenty and its way too costly to invest into two weapons when you can just funnel everything into one broken one. \n\nThis isn't inherently a problem necessarily but then it leads to runs becoming samey, you're just waiting until you get an OP combination and then just spamming that weapon at enemies, it leaves the combat loop lacking depth, the only skill thats really rewarded as a result is the ability to dodge enemies. There's no major tactics here, most characters except like, the monkey, have a clearly defined weapon type/s they're good with, so thats what you go for. \n\nYou want shotguns/melee, you play the bird, you want smgs/assault rfiles play the bunny, fire weapons? the fox. I wish the characters were more open-ended in their design, would be much more interesting for builds.\n\nOverall its not a bad game, just a shallow one. Don't go into this one expecting any major complexity or depth. You shoot the bad guys, dodge occasionally, and build around whatever rng has given you. It's a passable way to spend the time, but there's both roguelites and shooters out there that offer way more depth and engaging gameplay than this if thats what you're looking for.",

            "review": "Gunfire Reborn is easily the most polished, feature-rich, and addictive roguelite FPS on the market. The roguelike/roguelite genre as a whole has had a slow journey into the FPS genre-hybrid, and among all of its competitors I would consider Gunfire Reborn to be essentially peerless at the moment. Don't let the whimsical, cartoonish artstyle put you off of an amazingly gratifying instanced looter-shooter experience-- even back in early access this game managed to squeeze roughly 50 hours of playtime out of me, and now that the game is in its finished 1.0 state and is being updated with small character/weapon DLCs, its calling me back for EVEN MORE runs.\n\nThe core gameplay in this game is PHENOMENAL. Well paced, deeply satisfying, and deceptively complex. Each weapon you happen upon during a run is amazingly unique and intricate-- and beyond that, each weapon drop comes with an additional set of modifiers to add to its unique characteristics. Gunfire Reborn's weapon roster spans a delightful range of forms & figures; including hefty rocket launchers, nimble SMGs, 'Iron Man' style laser gloves, flaming kunai, and much more. The game's arsenal has something for every mood and every playstyle, which is absolutely crucial to the gameplay loop of any roguelite.\nSomething else integral to a roguelite's depth is power-ups, or modifiers. Throughout each of its stages, Gunfire Reborn will present the player with heaps of augments to specialize your build. Building a run based on fire damage? Start boosting your elemental DOT! Relying heavily on grenade spam? Increase your grenade's damage or carrying capacity! Feeling sluggish? Why not invest heavily in movement upgrades? This build diversity helps Gunfire Reborn to succeed not just as a first person shooter, but also as a bonafide roguelite.\nThe level design is fantastic as well in this game! Each zone feels memorable and diverse, as well as being loaded with uniquely challenging enemies. Complete with secret zones, shop/upgrade NPCs, as well as a variety of level bosses, progressing through a run of Gunfire Reborn is a satisfyingly impactful and atmospheric experience, in no small part due to the actual locales it will have you fight your way through.\nSpeaking of fighting: The enemies you will be pitted against during your run are wonderfully imaginative and (for the most part) always a joy to fight. The game's cartoon style, while perhaps off-putting to some, lends itself to some fantastic enemy designs. Possessed terracotta soldiers, teleporting bird snipers, fireball casting lizard sorcerers, umbrella shaped yokai, giant rocket lobsters-- its all here, and waiting to swiftly end your run. Enemies are also occasionally given special shield/armour bars, which are weak to specific elemental damage types, further deepening the combat/character building experience. Fans of the 'Borderlands' franchise should feel right at home with this elemental weakness/resistance system. At the best of times, Gunfire Reborn's enemy variety serves to give it a frantic, almost \"boomer shooter\"-esque quality-- and one I find to be sorely lacking among other roguelite FPS games. \nThe art direction is very colourful and engaging, and paints a picture of a chaotic, vibrant fantasy world. While the animations aren't necessarily in the same league as the work of modern triple A titles, enemy movement, reload animations, boss attacks, etc... are all very fluid and expressive. Gunfire Reborn might not be a gritty, hardcore take on the FPS genre, it isn't trying to be, and benefits on the whole from its stylization.\nSound design in this game is... mostly pretty good. Gunshots feel impactful, minor FX and embellishments are solid, dealing/receiving damage feels responsive, and the character voice lines are... alright. Gunfire Reborn may not have the same immersive soundscapes as something like CoD or Battlefield, but its eccentric sound design works well within its cartoon artstyle.\n\nOverall, Gunfire Reborn is a deeply mechanically satisfying and nicely polished FPS roguelite, and currently stands out as the absolute best of its hybrid genre. (Not that there's a TON of competition at the moment.) The game is still being updated with free content as well as paid DLCs at the time of writing this review, so its only getting more dense with features as time goes on. Gunfire Reborn is absolutely the type of game that will have you glued to your chair at 3am, promising yourself that THIS run will TOTALLY be LAST ONE of the night. (It won't.) I love this game deeply, and if you're a fan of roguelikes/roguelites and/or FPS games, there's a solid chance that YOU will too.",

            "review": "[h1] Ignore the Content Creators on YouTube. Not only is it not better, it's just not the Battlefield you wanted [/h1]\n\n[u] Read that title again [/u]\n\n     I'm trying, I'm really trying to enjoy this game. I've put in many hours on launch, as well as on alternate accounts, even playing it on friend's consoles as it was patched, and \"fixed\", and balanced. It just doesn't work. Many of the issues with the game that aren't related to the terrible map balancing (which is still very prevalent) or the awful weapon design persist here in this title. The overall \"feel\" of the game is just off, and I can't quite put my finger on it. \n\n   The bones of the game are still very much geared towards the \"Specialist\" hero-shooter system that the entire core gameplay was designed around, and no amount of changing or updating is going to fix that. Weapon balancing is still laughable, some weapons generally have a fantastic TTK (Time To Kill) and feel very natural to shoot, while others are laughably nerfed into the point of being useless. I have been able to kill people with a 9mm \"carbine pistol\" sidearm [i]faster[/i] than I have been able to kill with the same amount of direct hits using the dual 30mm autocannon on the real life equivalent LAV. The M4 Launcher is unable to kill soft-skinned vehicles when they are shot in the rear with multiple rounds. The high-explosive shells of the Abrams are unable to hill soldiers with splash damage when the round detonates on the wall right next to them. \n\n   [u]It just doesn't work. [/u]\n\nA quick list of grievances;\n[list]\n    [*] Weapons have no tangible weight to them. Due to the high-speed COD-clone angle that was taken with the gameplay, many of the weapons feel light. Follow-up shots with sniper rifles, being able to consistently understand your drop principle, how many shots it \"should\" take to down a enemy player. All these things make the ranged gameplay frustrating. Rate Of Fire (ROF) is directly tied to the users framerate, but incoming damage is reflected by game values. Network stutters will lead to you losing a firefight because your weapon went from a 800RPM to a variable 400-600RPM. \n\n    [*] Vehicle on Vehicle damage seems random at best. Using rounds optimized for defeating armor routinely fail to critically damage enemy vehicles when they are shot from the side or rear. Shooting helicopters has a \"roulette\" feeling of whether or not it will consistently kill in one hit.\n\n    [*] Cheating is still very prevalent in the game. Wallhacking, insta-downing people with a single shot, or general hyper-mobility are still commonly seen in game.\n\n    [*] Many maps still have design issues when regarding spawn-camping. Many of them become \"meat-grinders\" if the enemy team is able to push you back to your spawn, with very few capabilities to escape. Spawns [i]have[/i] been improved, but there are still many issues with spawning in line-of-sight of enemy players or armor.\n\n    [*] Vehicles feel pretty terrible to pilot. Granted there are some [u]fantastic[/u] players in this game who execute some amazing moves, but for the rest of us who can't grind this game for 12 hours a day to learn all the quirks the vehicles feel sloppy and inconsistent\n\n   There is a lot to love. The portal system is great for playing a Battlefield that knew what it wanted to be. The speed-swap attachment system is great, and has saved my ass plenty of times. Verticality and movement feels (relatively) smooth and can lead to some really great moments in the game. \n\n  All this being said, it's just not the Battlefield that fans of Battlefield 4 wanted with the take on the modern shooter. With hackers become more and more rampant on the fan-supported servers for BF4, many of us wanted to turn to 2042 to have an experience that could \"scratch that itch\". What we instead have is a game that looks like Battlefield, plays like Fortnight, and wanted to be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.",

This is not only extremely toxic behavior coming straight out of a billion-dollar company that is behaving like a spoiled brat, screeching and kicking because someone told them they did something bad, but also goes completely against their own terms and services, where it clearly states you can be only punished for in-game transgressions like text chat and VOIP. Meaning EA is actively harassing content creators for the content of their videos.\nSo if you want to waste your money on this game and support a company that breaks its own rules and harrases people because they have the \"wrong\", non-approved opinion like some dystopian fascist state from the book 1984, go ahead. Otherwise, get BF4 as that game has more content and players than this game will ever have.",

They also reworked the specialist system, where now every class has a unique gadget that contributes to their team, while each specialist has something unique to them to make their own play style. This fixes the game so that every class has a responsibility to uphold, while each specialist provides versatility and customization to your play style. So if you want to play Battlefield 2042 the way it was intended when it first launched, I highly recommend playing it now. You will not be disappointed.",

For the same price I paid for this mess I could have purchased 13 litres of gasoline and got more entertainment out of that.\n\nReality is here, it has been since 2011, we will never see or get to play another real/good \"Battlefield\" title game again. EA/Dice are living in another realm where they have no idea what the players want but think they do. It gets worse every year, and just when you think it couldn't get any worse, EA is beginning to close official server support for their older Battlefield titles, a true f*** you to their true dedicated player base. I hope the new Battlefield franchise rots entirely. EA/Dice have blown it for so long now I don't see it ever coming back and if their next Battlefield title is as horrendous as this is, it's over for them.\n\nIf you must try it, buy it on sale 75% off or better. There's enough content in the game for it to be worth that, but the game is still bland and really just something to laugh at if anything. Just remember it took them a YEAR and a half just to kind of at best get this game in an \"okay\" state to play, do you really want to play and support something such as that?",

I don't like the system much, it's unnecessary for what battlefield was always about, but since they reintroduced main classes recently, they aren't that game impacting anymore. They offer certain subperks/weapons for the classes, but things like the repair tool are standard loadout for every engineer specialist again (as it should always have been). Are specialists ugly visually? definitely, having the same dude in a different outfit running around is an awful concept but imo it impacts the game far less than people think it does. \n\noh, and don't buy the game for the portal mode. that is probably by far the most justified thing to be upset over with the game, since it's a complete let down and not used much. Suffers from the same thing as every game with a play-into-matchmake button does: Nobody actually uses a server browser anymore, because hitting play is easier. ",

The remastered graphics are a sin to its legacy.\n\n[b]Halo 2:[/b] Likely the best shooter ever created. My favorite in the series. I can't even put into words how much I adore this game. The story, characters, atmosphere, everything is just perfection! (Totally not bias) The remastered graphics did everything right and only enhance the game further!\n\n[b]Halo 3:[/b] Second only to Halo 2, another grand master of shooters, one of the best gaming experiences you can get! No other Halo has captured the same lightning in a bottle this game had. A golden era game.\n\n[b]Halo 3 ODST:[/b] Not my favorite, but by no means a bad game! Telling a great story from a perspective we've not seen before or since in the series.\n\n[b]Halo Reach:[/b] The final game from the Bungie era, a fantastic sendoff to the series. With crisp and more modernized gameplay, It tells a fantastic and gritty story leading up to the events of Halo CE. Yet another that can not be beaten.\n\n[b]Halo 4:[/b] The begging of the end. The first sign of Halo's terminal disease known as 343. The start of the series slow, painful death. Garbage in every way.",

Solutions online suggest you verify integrity of game files (done), cap fps at 60 for all players (done), and finally reconfigure your router settings so that all players have an 'Open NAT'. I remember reconfiguring my router settings 15 years ago to play Halo 3 online, it is asinine that this is still an issue. The MCC was released in 2020 and yet even now network issues persist. Reading through the Steam discussions, these connection errors are very common. I would refund this game if I still could. It is a bare minimum ask that a multiplayer-oriented game have functional co-op multiplayer, which the MCC does not.",

            "review": "Call of Duty has officially hit rock bottom as of recently\n\nI've been a Veteran fan of the series ever since BO1 and would defend this franchise always, but after everything Activision has done to repay back to the few loyal fans of this franchise is absolutely disgusting and needs to be heard.\n\n1. When it was announced that there won't be a COD for 2023 and that MW2 will instead receive a \"Premium Expansion\", everyone thought that Activision has finally listened to us and won't be releasing another yearly COD and instead allowing a 2 year live-service into MW2 and we all believed in this title which lead to MW2 being the Number 1 best selling game in 2022. What do you do now Activision? Maybe continue the 2 year live-service to make this the best COD since BO2 and continue fixing the game? NO. Instead Activision tricked us all and changes their mind that there will be a COD in 2023 and there will no longer be a \"Premium Expansion\" but instead a standalone COD release which all of a sudden became MW3??? (Which isn't even being created by Infinity Ward but instead SLEDGEHAMMER).\n\n2. Ok so you fucked up on the 2 Year live-Service and expansion, how is MW2 been? I mean it was advertised as the most innovative and expansive COD of all time. One thing positive i can say is this game definitely had more content at launch, but still we just got yet another Incomplete game that needed more content and bug fixes and SBMM is still is a huge problem that hasn't been fixed at all. While this game has received updates, it has been done very poorly and at a snail's pace. First Warzone/DMZ wasn't even here at launch and had to take a few weeks to be added and we barely get 2 maps a season, a few game modes and a small amount of weapons in which 75% of the weapons are locked behind the battle pass and are insanely overpowered so more players buy the battle pass and instead we get more content focusing on spending money in MW2 like Battle Passes, weapon blueprints, bundles and useless skins and operators like adding Messi or TimTheTatman which seems to be more of Activision's focus instead of fixing or adding content to the game. With all the problems being said, you'd think Activision might've listened to player feedback and try to focus on fixing the game and releasing more updates right? NO. Instead Activision doubles down and releases P2W skins for DMZ making P2W players have an advantage and releasing a £25 Blackcell bundle with a battle pass, Gold skins and Cod Points whereas before that would be the price of two Black ops 1 or 2 expansions adding maps and weapons to the game, and Activision hasn't fixed it's huge problems like the game still not having content and content that should've been at launch and the game CRASHING randomly but instead ADDING more problems into the game like ruining performance for this game, it's actually shocking that COD BO2 had 300 people work on the game and that game was complete with Expansions but this game had over 3000 people working on it but yet they are all incapable and incompetent of fixing the game and releasing content which basically led to players losing interest in this game and leaving.\n\n3. With MW2 being a dumpster fire and players already leaving the game to play older COD games to have fun, what does Activision do now? They see their community and fans having fun in projects like SM2, X Labs, Plutonium or clients like BOIII or CoD 4X, you'd think they maybe should advertise their projects or support them like Valve if they are having fun right? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Activision took the biggest L and became Nintendo by basically sending cease and desist letters ordering the people behind these projects to take them down leading to projects like SM2, X Labs and the BOIII Client being gone now because Activision doesn't know how to make a good COD game and their community doing a way better job than them at making a fun game. These developers spent so much time in these projects and aren't even being paid by Activision to make these and are spending their time to create something fun so people can enjoy but Activision doesn't like to see their fans having fun so they kill their community and fans by doing disgusting tactics like this.\n\n4. The breaking point that lead to this was the security issues, apparently ALL COD GAMES have a security issue that can lead to your IP getting Stolen or your account getting hacked, yes even COD MW2 their newest game is vulnerable to this issue and Activision is doing nothing to stop this. This just proves that they don't care about us having an enjoyable experience in their games but only care when we spend money on their store, they have billions of money and developers in this game yet they continue to disappoint and not let any of their fans have fun in their games yet Indie developers are able to do 10X better than companies like Activision at offering a fun and enjoyable experience. The fact that you can't even offer the bare minimum of players being secure and safe in your NEWEST GAMES shows how Incompetent, Lazy and Out of Touch you people are in 2023.\n\nSo after everything that has happened to COD and Activision constantly screwing over their community and fans(where Activision doesn't even deserve any of their fans) We should come together and just outright boycott MW3 releasing this year, yes as much this may sound stupid or petty, Activision is a company that only cares about people buying their games and receiving money and not allowing people having fun or creating projects and quite frankly should deserve a ton of lawsuits and their acquisition with Microsoft/Xbox to fall apart since Activision does not deserve their money or being apart of Xbox. If money is all they care about and not the player enjoyment then we should at least hurt their sales for COD MW3 to show that they should care about their community and players having fun instead of continuously screwing over their fan-base by taking down projects and not prioritizing the user's safety.\n\nI miss when franchises like COD, Battlefield and Halo were good, i want to go back to those years.....",

Your time is better spent with another game.\n\nI want to like this game, but Activision sure as hell don't like us. The nasty manipulative money grubbing practices you find in here is disgraceful. Only the guns you buy with real money are good, bundles are over $20 on average and the skins are mostly trash (with a few exceptions) and the skins which are actually nice can cost upwards of $30 including tax! They do everything they can to make you want to buy guns to get the edge in a fight or buy a skin with built in killstreaks so you can fight in DMZ pay to win style!! All they do is try to trick their way into your wallet.\n\nTHEN on top of that, the maps are subpar, oddly small with no thought put into spawns or spawn camping, flow of the game, movement, shooting, sniping, ANYTHING! There are 10 different game modes which are all just search and destroy with different names...... why?! The cheaters are rampant and blatant, not even trying to hide, and why would they? Reporting and anti cheat do literally nothing. People literally stream this game cheating and going \"Yeah they'll never do anything about it\".\n\nI miss the good ol days when I would jump on COD with a few buds and have 'fun'. \"Maybe one of us will get a nuke.\"  or  \"OH WORD LET'S GO!! I GOT DOGS\"  or  \"Hey, who want's to try some dumb strat just for fun!\" \n\nNow it's \"Hey I'm on COD.... I'm just on to make some battlepass progress... No I'm not playing warzone or DMZ that shits full of hackers\"  or  \"Dude why do some of these guns shoot nerf darts, I've hit this guy with half my mag!\"  or  \"Dude even this guy's team is reporting him for cheating and nothing is being done\"  or  \"No I only play shipment 24/7. Less cheaters and less game time so I can get off cod faster after grinding some battlepass xp\"\n\nThat last quote makes me the saddest. No one I know plays cod for fun anymore... we treat it like a job because we spent money on it and don't want to admit that what we did..... was a waste. And I know that I'll play it again because I want to spend time with my friends... I just wish we had a better game to spend time together on. \n\nI know I'm just one guy, so when I say \"I am never buying another COD unless they fix these problems and go back to making the game FUN and not an AFK money farm for their corporate masters\"  It's got all the threat of a growling puppy. But it's all I got. I've been burned too many times by these people, and these days... money is too tight to be spending it on a headache. \n\nI ask you, please, don't waste your time or money here. There are plenty of other games and companies worth your time and money. This game is nothing but an exercise in frustration and manipulative legal robbery.",

            "review": "Since the start of Lightfall and even before that Bungie has started on a path of trying to kill the game instead of making it better. Constant server issues that only get worse with each week while hearing nothing from Bungie on why the issues are occurring, if they will get better, or if they can even be fixed. Mind numbing changes that only seek to hurt the players for no reason.\n\nThe most recent stompees nerf that removes all movement speed from the exotic due to controller players not being able to \"look up\". There is also the titan shoulder charge nerf that now causes you to lose energy after shoulder charging even if it does not hit an enemy. While being a PvP nerf, PvE is being hit by this nerf due to the developers dying on the hill of not separating the sandboxes. While this change may not seem that impactful, let me also add that shoulder charge has worked the same way for the last 9 years. Warlocks are getting starfire not just nerfed but murdered. Starfire has needed a nerf for a while as it is an extremely dominate exotic but instead of nerfing it to be more in line with other exotics the developers have almost made it a punishment to use the exotic. Grenade energy used to be 20% while in an empowering rift and is now down to 2.5%. Lastly, lets talk about the incredible band-aid fixes to the game. The 2 second weapon cooldown. Now if you ever swap weapons in your inventory you have to wait 2 seconds before you are allowed to fire your weapon in a SHOOTER. To give some examples this would be similar to not being able to use the brakes in your vehicle should you accidentally press them or be on a very busy interstate, instead you need to wait 2 seconds. \n\nFinally, there is the price increase of each expansion and now the increase in prices of seasons by an extra 5 dollars. I'm not even going to get into the costs of the game as in my stance I normally buy the most expensive edition as I play the game a lot unfortunately but going the cheaper route is even more expensive. From the expansions to now increased season price and dungeon keys the game is not only offering so little for that cost but also doing nothing to improve the game server wise, it's only getting worse.\n\nFor my last bit of advice, if you are new to the game or think about checking it out and never having played Destiny. \n\nSTAY FAR AWAY\n\nThis game is the most unfriendly new player experience I have ever witnessed. Playing through the New Light aka New player experience as an experienced person shows the issues with the game and what it's not teaching new players. The craziest part is this feedback has been given to Bungie the last 2-3 years now and yet they still refuse how to teach new players to play the game. Instead they teach new players how to play a game for their very first time. For instance, they teach you that \"Space Bar\" is jump instead of teaching you that weapons within destiny have different perk combinations on them, or that subclasses have different benefits and how to properly use them in combat.\n\nFrom recent events it is apparent that the team that worked on the game during the Beyond Light era and even the Witch Queen era is gone. They are either working on one of the 7 trillion new projects that Bungie has spread themselves too thin doing or went to a new game studio.",

            "review": "Destiny 2 is a black hole for your time.\n\nI find myself coming back every time a new piece of content is dropped, but this is out of no love of the content that I am receiving. Attempting to introduce Destiny 2 to new players reveals the number of fatal flaws this game's business model contains, namely that it's now essentially impossible for new people to get invested in Destiny as a franchise.\n\nOld content has been vaulted away, never to be seen again. This includes but is not limited to the original campaign that this game was offering as it's primary story (of which future content would build upon rather than replace). The story of Destiny 2 is unplayable within Destiny 2, all that remains are DLCs priced the same as full installments for AAA releases.\n\nLightfall was particulary dissapointing, but arguably the decline began in Shadowkeep, and even the original Red War campaign was never that good. The game is fundamentally a grind-fest, not to mention the numerous arbitrary limitations on resources and currencies to make that grind as painful and tedious as possible.\n\nHarder content that most dedicated players would say is the point of playing the game, like Raids and Dungeons, is either locked behind a seemingly endless line of filler content pretending to be story, or is locked behind a completely arbitrary power cap that is constantly increasing due to rampant power creep.\n\nI could go on but I don't need to.\nI will still continue to play this game, purely out of my sunk-cost fallacy.\nBungie, I liked you during the Halo days, but now you've turn sour.\n\nBring back ALL of the vaulted legacy content, remove all of the arbitrary limit on resources, and actually try to make a DLC campaign that does more than look nice and waste your time (and money). THEN, we'll talk.",

I never had the attitude that Bungie could do no wrong but I wanted to believe  they would continue to evolve the game and make it better. Lightfall launched and I felt like many, it was a huge disappointment and did little if nothing to evolve the franchise. I didn't even finish the campaign, and took a 2 week break from the game 2 weeks later, like someone in an abusive relationship, I decided to log back on and finish the campaign and other content I had paid 100 dollars for/ I was met with a message that said I was banned. This was very confusing to me seeing as I never used cheats or did anything I was aware of that was against T.o.s. There was no way to contact bungie  other than their terribly implemented forums. Upon submitting an appeal all I got in response was that the ban would not be overturned. They did not provide me with any reason as to why I was banned ( because there wasn't one ) . Myself and many others had thousands of hours of their time and over a thousand dollars of content  wrongly taken from them with no recourse and no explanation. I never thought i would say this but because of this i feel bungie is more predatory than activision/ blizzard  in this manner because even they would not issue a permaband with no explanation.\n\nTLDR\nDo not play this game unless you wish to have thousands of hours and dollars wrongly taken from you with no explanation why.Any one who gives a dime to this company is setting a dangerous precedent that gaming developers do not have to be accountable to the players who support them. If you're looking for a good mmo experience there are plenty of much better mmos . The game had potential 5 years ago and it was squandered . Not only that but Bungies had decided to cannibalize their most loyal player in a lukewarm attempt to be perceived as doing something to fix the many broken aspects of the game. I don't thing disappointed even sums up how i and many other feel about bungie,\n",

I dislike the game's business practices since they infringe on the gameplay and loot available. It's extremely repetitive on the seasonal level as Destiny attempts to be a game you give ALL your time to and its the same thing...every season...Play this game as much as you want but just know that all Bungie's hard work goes to their micro transaction store instead of game play. Save yourself countless hours. The grinds are not worth the highs in comparison to lows. Enjoy as you will I spent like 700 bucks on expansions and dlcs combines since all the days of D1. This game is FPS league of legends. Dont let your friends play it\n",

            "review": "Don't think I've ever played a fun, exciting game like this that actively suffers from timed content in such a prolific way. There are so many builds that rely on certain weapons that you can't obtain anymore. I'm a returning player who skipped all of Beyond Light Launch and onward until Lightfall, and god it is just so painful to see a cool build or a build that is *required* for some sub-classes to even function well in any meaningful content... And have the weapon that makes the build work require a catalyst that is now a random drop, or you can't even get anymore if you tried. Seasonal weapons have done a great job as the game's life as gone on to address pain points of boring loot and weak rolls, but now a player who has missed even just one season can be behind forever... Now there *are* ways for these weapons to 'come back'. With set rolls on vendors, at random completely indiscernible times for a week at most. I waited for a Calus Mini Tool SMG with demolition and/or Incandescent to be available all the first two seasons of Lightfall for my solar builds (builds that are now much weaker due to season of the deep's mods)... And it just hasn't reappeared. I had to settle for a much less effective weapon and weapon type I could craft just to function on my solar builds. This pattern is repeated with Arc builds this season, where my Thunderlord hasn't gotten a catalyst to drop and I have no good primary/special weapons for arc to use.\n\nDestiny is super fun, really! It's extremely exciting, the effects are all top-notch, enemy design is varied and there is alot of challenging raids and content... But, back when I was playing the game years ago, we didn't have to buy dungeons. We paid less for expansions and seasons, and retained the same amount of content. Now, not only has these been brought up in price, and dungeons now being sold separately from the normal game... Bungie are making more money every year then last. They are making two more brand new games, one of which was just announced. They are not doing this, nickle and diming every last piece of content, to make the game. They are doing it to make a profit. So, as such, these problems amount to alot of frustration. For now, unless you've been playing this game since it started or years prior to this review, avoid at all costs. It's not worth it, period.",

Gunshots don't register, suppressed shots pull every zombie with a 20 km radius. Zombie path finding is absurd, you run through the woods, through 15 buildings across a river and over a mountain and the zombie chasing you is on your ass and not even broken a sweat. Loot spawn sucks. You get hungry / die of starvation way too quickly. Trying to constantly repair your gear sucks. Weapons break after 5 swings/shots. Sickness sucks, in the \"cold\" for 2 seconds? Fatally ill. The new sprain/broken leg system sucks, get hit by one zombie? Broken leg, wince and blurred screen with every step. Oh and good f**king luck finding a vehicle.\n\nGame is just laborious.  After all this time they've made it prettier, it gets good frame rates. But what does it matter when the core game is still ass.",

For me, the combat doesn't capture the actual feeling of casting spells, and tactical elements like movement, defense, and control make up of less of the combat than I'd prefer. I feel it makes things things lack depth and more of just a slugfest.\n\nOverall, not a terribly designed class concept on Arcanist, I think its more the core mechanics of ESO that are just not for me. Which is frustrating, because the concept of aiming, along with active block, dodge, and interrupt to off balance are good mechanics. \n\nOne other complaint is that solo PVE questing difficulty remains mind numbingly easy, without much need to really utilize those core mechanics listed above. It was a complaint I had with World of Warcraft as well, and following this model of being able to pve in any zone at any time sort of removed the challenge, which was what required building skill and equipment. In order for such a repetitive game model as an MMO to stay engaging for me, it has to require that combat, as it represents a majority part of playtime, be more reactive than something that simply relies on the same constant rotation of a meta spec.",

It would have been nice if the Telvanni Peninsula had a more unique identity rather than just being a clone of Vvardenfell, something more akin to how Tamriel Rebuilt portrayed it would have been much better.\n\nAll in all, Necrom’s not perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction, which gives me hope for future ESO expansions.",

But this? This is from what I've been able to play an amazing chunk of content. Interesting stories, a fun new class to play ass, cool characters, a stunning new part of the world to explore, and many neat little collectibles to earn really make me think that this is a good new direction for the game to take. More of this please! \n\nOh, and thanks for supporting Tales of Tribute, the Card-game added in High Isle. I LOVE this game and today I was pleasantly surprised to find that Necrom also adds a new Deck to play with. Can't wait to unlock that. :D",

        "notes": "This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Alexios or Kassandra, mercenaries on a quest for vengeance. As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., “Anything goes in this sex andron”; “That is love, this is commerce. What are you into?”); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game. "

This game is definitely beautiful and large. \n\nThe story is amazing, if you like the main thing in the lore of Assassins creed, this game definitely gives you a lot of info on it. And choices you make matter, i will definitely be playing it with new game+ and do things that i wish i had done differently. But i recommend you to play it not knowing what choices do what down the line, since you can play as the female [spoiler] Kassandra [/spoiler] , and or the male [spoiler] Alexios [/spoiler].\n\nAt the start of the game i felt a bit overwhelmed by everything, but after exploring a bit and doing some quests i got a hang of it. \nin comparison to Origins, its not as good, but its still a Master piece!\n\nThe main quests and side quests are great, but there are these quests all around that have a time glass on them, those quests feel poorly made. Most of the dialogue in those quests are interesting at the start, but then when it comes to what they want you to do, it defaults to the same ones over and over and over again. so i just skip the dialogue most of the time. Although very rarely they will say something new. Often you get a dialogue decision to ask them what they want from you, but its always just answer nr1, so it feels tedious, like they added it in to make you want to listen to the dialogue, which after 100 hours, I don't. These quests are also the main way (from what I've seen) to get XP and money, and they are usually very short and just boring.\n\nFor some reason they designed the horse to trot when you are 200 meters within a city, town, fort or whatever, and it doesn't matter if its way above you on a cliff, your horse will not gallop. Which is extremely annoying and i don't understand why they did this\n\nThey have a great system for your armor and weapons, where you can change the look of your armor to any you have received. although i don't understand why epic armor has 3 engravings enabling you to get 4, while the legendary armor only has 2 unless you have the complete set which then you get 3, plus you could add the 4th. but this makes the epic armor way better in most cases, as you can get much better engravings on them than the legendary. \n\nThe combat is alright, similar to Origins except you don't have a shield.\n\nThe game doesn't really tell you how to change arrows except in the loading screens where it occasionally pops up telling you to press g to switch arrows, didn't see that hint until like 40 hours in, and at that point i just googled it.\n\nThe boat battles are cool, and different from the old games, in a good way. the upgrades get ridiculously expensive, but you make the money back fast, but the resources can be a hassle.\n\nI have a lot more I could say about this game, but I think I've covered what stood out the most for me\n\nI Recommend this game, you get a long playtime and it has good replay value.",

From the stunning Ancient Greek landscapes and cities, to the engaging storyline and engaging combat and stealth mechanics, this game has a lot of exciting content and provides hours of quality entertainment. With its big open world packed with side-quests, bounties and mysterious artifacts to uncover, this game will keep you hooked for weeks. One of the most standout aspects of the game is its incredible attention to detail, with period-accurate buildings, characters, and artwork. The game also features an engaging narrative that takes its time to tell, allowing for some truly fascinating moments that will leave a lasting impression. With its deep character customization and upgrade systems, Odyssey also provides a unique and varied experience that can be tailored to the player’s preference. While some aspects of the game can be tedious, it never detracts from the overall experience, and the engaging gameplay kept me coming back for more. Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is an enjoyable action-adventure game with an enormous amount of content, engaging combat, and an interesting storyline. Its immersive world and varied mechanics provide an enjoyable, memorable experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and engaging game.",

            "review": "First of all, as preface, I have achieved basically 100% in this game including the two DLCs so one could I say I really love and adore this game. \n\nHaving said that, this game is definitely not a perfect game for everyone. The story is a tad bit bland overall and isn't what hooked me in this game. I mostly ignored the main quest really until I powered through it in one or two sittings. Adding to that, this game didn't feel as much as a typical game in the Assassins Creed series but more as a RPG in the world of Assassins Creed, which is totally fine for me because it's still a great game, but I understand everyone who was a little disappointed.\nWhat really chained to this game though, is the world building and the main character (DISCLAIMER: I played as Kassandra). \nKassandra to me, was one of the most loveable (and hot; I admit it :) ) protagonists I've ever played with. I love her personality and attitude but also the genuine sorrow and grief they were able to make her show. On top of that, her voice actress/also her motion double did such an outstanding job.\nNow to the world the developing team put out: I'm not from Greece and hvae only been there a few times, but I absolutely loved every second of exploring the ancient version. They really made the world feel alive and inhabitated and while fulfilling objectives on the map was, due to it being mostly Copy and Paste as Ubisoft typically does, pretty boring most of the times, I still had the motivation to keep going the whole distance. And let me tell you: The world is actually enormous. Part of the reason I kept going definitely were the mechanics overall and especially during fighting. The ability tree is really well made and almost all abilities feel useful at some point and in some build. Naturally some abilities are generally more useful than other but the overall balance is very good.\n\nIn short: I really enjoyed the game and it is a really good RPG, probably one of the best I have ever played and I enjoyed every second I played.",

Nice story, good gameplay (of the new AC RPG-style, not older AC, not better not worse, just different)\nBut recently I launch the game again, wanting to fully finish it. And here's an invasive UBI Launcher, that requires me to create an account. This thing will take space on my disk, need updates, push newsletters and advertisement on me. Besides you just can't play if UBI servers are offline. The game worked perfectly without it.\nThis is shameful methods. I'll check on the game in few years to see if launcher is removed and update my review then.\n\ntl;dr : awesome game, go for it if you don't mind predatory commercial practices",

And then there is nothing left to do. there is no new game plus. no new quests. So it's kind of better to wait to do the dlc so you can actually enjoy the ISU artifacts.",

Worth on sale. \n\nEdit: I didn't realize this game had gotten such poor feedback. Seems to be trendy to hate on AC games, sure it's quite expensive and similar to previous titles. But it delivers a TON of content with a decent story and introducing many new systems. Playing on the highest difficulty the combat has actually been fairly challenging with many different types of fights and unique enemies. If you liked Odyssey and Origins, chances are you will like this game as well. I am not one to stick up for Ubisoft, but it's a bit silly to see so many people jumping on the hate-bandwagon. ",

Over the years the countless sequels in the franchise, and following in the footsteps of such epic masterpieces as Origins and Odyssey has certainly numbed our senses. It might feel mediocre until you actually try any other of the less polished competitors to realize how masterly crafted it is. Surprisingly the main reason it feels so bland is because almost everything is in it's place, within a seamless world, with excellent story arcs, surprise cameos, plausible and clever plot twists smooth and a lot more.\n\nIt has it's issues - random freezes here and there, some effort/reward discrepancies, minor inconveniences but the positives, especially if you can take it as a standalone product and not just another brick in the series are truly overwhelming.",

It seriously took me 12 hours to get through the prologue. But it's very beautiful though, and if you can get over the grindyness you might enjoy it. Those first 12 hours exploring the nice mountains of Norway was nice. Makes me kinda wish the game stayed around there. Also why the hell is there a cash shop in a single player game that you're still selling for full price?!",

In the end, it is a good game at the start, but as a whole repetitive and eventually: boring.",

            "review": "This game was interesting at first. The combat was difficult, the tactics of Odyssey don't work the same, and the story was compelling enough. There was a point early on where your actions while roaming seemed to have consequences, so I was hopeful. But as it went on... combat became universally easy. Before midgame, I was already unstoppable. I never needed to eat rations anymore. The puzzles were just \"Find the oil jar and carry it to the breakable wall\" or \"Shoot the breakable part of the wall just under the roof and climb through\" over and over, for supplies I haven't needed ever because they become literally free in bulk for some ungodly reason or silver for settlement decorations. Whoop-de-doo. The fishing takes forever for minimal rewards, Orlog was a decent time-killer, but not very helpful, flyting was actually cool, but ultimately a small part of the game. Even the DLC stuff only seemed to give you cosmetics or weapons and armor that were worse than what you already had.\nBut what I hated was the lack of any actual choices. They'd always present seemingly important decisions, and as soon as you think it through and make a decision, the game would make it painfully obvious that the choice didn't matter. Solve a mystery and identify a traitor? Doesn't matter, Eivor will [spoiler]explain that that's the guy in private and then stand back as he monologues and kills everyone with the wine you literally just said was poisoned[/spoiler]. Who should you bribe to end the war? Doesn't matter, your companion will [spoiler]murder the hostage and start the war back up immediately[/spoiler]. Dialogue option 1, 2, or 3? Doesn't matter, if you choose 1 or 2, Eivor will just say 3 afterwards anyway. There's five supposedly big choices that affect the end of the game Witcher 3-style, but the impact is basically just [spoiler]whether your brother likes you or not post-game[/spoiler]. I got this on sale, but it was way too monotonous and disappointing to play again.",

            "review": "I loved Assassin's Creed games in the past. But this will be the first Assassin's Creed game that I have played and not completely finished. Ubisoft outdid themselves this time and in a bad way. \n\nI am starting to believe that artists and location designers are the only people left at Ubisoft that still actually know how to do their stuff. Everything else feels raw, unfinished, boring or downright bad. I'll try to summarize the key points, starting with the things that are sort of done well:\n\n1) Locations. AC has always been a visual \"image of an era\" and Valhalla is no exception. Nordic winter vistas, fjords, nithing cursed sites, decaying Roman ruins with straw huts around them, druid forests, frankish villages - they are all visually interesting to look at and take screenshots of. And this is probably the only thing that I really have no issues with.\n\n2) Music. It's nice, with some quite memorable tracks, like Hrafnsmál - The Words Of The Raven. And it's an immense pain that in actual game the music has been MURDERED with compression. And actually that goes to the sound quality overall - everything is super quiet and compressed it makes you wonder what those 150GB that the game takes are actually for if they can't fit 30-40 songs in good quality in there.\n\n3) Graphics. LOD quality leaves a lot to be desired and textures are weirdly inconsistent. For example, you can have a super detailed Eivor face right next to the 2005 texture quality level shirt that looks like it barely has normalmaps. Snow and snowy dirt barely have proper detail on them as well, especially in Norway. This makes for a very jarring experience when you can't stop noticing the badly done stuff. Again, what are 150GB of game size for if good textures aren't part of it, apparently?\n\nTAA in Valhalla is absolutely atrocious, it murders every bit of detail unless you play at 4K or such. I had played at max settings at 1440p and my game was a blurry mess at native resolution. Valhalla can look decent... nice, even - especially in some cities or unique locations, BUT - you have to jump through some hoops to get it to look better. I had to force my resolution scale to 180% and enforce Nvidia Sharpening and Texture pop filters (5 and 10% respectively) to make it look better.\n\n4) Story. It's alright, but feels a lot like an afterthought for an already selected location for the game. I can't shake this feeling even in DLCs and their respective stories. None of the characters are memorable, they flash through your eyes in a caleidoscope of territory pledge quests, about an hour screen time each maybe. When Ubisoft tries to do emotional moments in story, it just doesn't hit because you can't care less for them. If you wanted to roleplay tough viking that actually paints English shores red with blood, to reave and plunder properly - tough luck, you'll still get punished for killing monks and \"civilians\". And of course main and side stories are spoiled with quota NPCs like black vikings, gay Lunden reeves and so on and so forth. Beating a dead horse at this point but I had to mention it.\n\n5) General gameplay, combat and gear/loot system. Everything I had loathed in Origins and Odyssey is even worse here. Don't believe anyone who told you this game is going to be shorter - it's far from that. At the time of writing this review I am 178 hours in and I still have Ireland, Asgard and multiple roguelite modes left to finish. Activities are littered across the map like cat poop. Every treasure chest, every stone cairn and fly agaric mushroom is now a simple puzzle, but they are repeated so many times it becomes annoying to an extreme. Parkour or physics based puzzles are especially frustrating because they are very clunky and buggy and controls have even worse responsiveness than Odyssey.\n\nI expected at least decent quests and I am super disappointed. Outside of two dozen main-ish questlines, there are only \"world events\" that are super short, super simple and are often downright nonsensical and/or cringe. Yes, I am talking about a lady farting from consuming viper eggs in Ledecestre, for example. This is horrible and Ubisoft should be ashamed of even putting it in, it's not even a comedic relief.\n\nCombat is a step up from Odyssey, in my opinion, but again, very buggy and woven with white threads - you will find your limbs and weapons awkwardly teleporting to your enemies more often than you'd like to see, which is pretty bad for a combat system that is trying to be flashy. Finisher animations are very few so you'll be forced to see the only one available per weapon again and again and again... and again. \n\nThe game is also laughably easy on normal difficulty and frustratingly bad with HP bar sponge enemies at anything higher than normal. Abilities are literally useless and act as \"press X to do slightly more damage\". The only actually useful active ability is an explosive arrow to destroy weak walls and save yourself some time from searching for an oil jar.\n\nGear and builds - all collectable weapons are unique now, so no loot nightmare from Odyssey but that barely matters because of what I wrote above. You'll either smite everything away by simply looking at it at a normal difficulty or will waste 5 minutes per enemy chipping at him without any enjoyment. \n\n6) Technical state of the game. It crashes. A lot. No, A LOT. Usually it happens because the game calls some unexisting function in Ubisoft Connect launcher, can't find it and closes itself completely. Your mileage may vary, but Valhalla is super crashy, be warned. \n\nAll that is spiced up with a traditional for Ubi at this point microtransaction store in a singleplayer game, XP and silver boosters and literal heaps of armor softlocked behind premium currency instead of being available as quest rewards or something. Plus the news about the new AC Mirage flying past Steam again reinforce me in my thought that supporting them was a bad decision and I should refrain from buying their products - it's indeed a product because I can't call it a game nor can I recommend anyone to waste time on it. \n\nUbisoft is incapable to learn and improve, it seems. Don't buy this game.",

I fell in love with Sims 2 back in the day but even that much older game felt like it had more “soul” than this empty husk of a game. \n\nDo I recommend it? Since it’s now free, sure. Why not check it out…but I will say that the fact that the base game is so shallow while a good deal of DLC is $30-$40 each doesn’t sit right with me. They even charge you $10 for the “privilege” of doing laundry. Take that as you may.",

They have COUNTLESS bugs and problems with each DLC that breaks the game in some way, shape or form. EA do NOT care about the player at all when it comes to THE SIMS all they care about is lining their own pockets with our HARD EARNED CASH.",

It was like the entire village i was in was changing along with the Sims I cared for. The Sims 4 is bland even with expansion packs. Believe me they will not fill the void left by the Sims 3. I have spent over 100+ dollars on some of the more higher rated packs and they really just don't fix the Sims 4 main problem, the Sims themselves. I might try to wait till sims 3 is on sale and get the entire pack that way. Sims 4 is a hard pass I promise. Do not spend your money on this product. Wait till Sims 5 or go replay Sims 3.",

As a long time fan of the franchise, I've been waiting to see how things have changed.. And they have changed a lot (compared to GoW I, II & III). This game moves GoW from the classic \"idk, I'm stronk, hack 'n slash everyone\" to more of a \"wait hang on, I need to take some time here\" contemplative challenge. The challenges presented are the right level of difficulty to be truly rewarding when completed. \nI just have to say, as a final note... Go. W has always captured my heart in terms of the story telling aspect, and this instalment has given me the strongest emotional reaction that I've had playing through this franchise to date.\nSomehow, you (Santa Monica Studios) have made me fall in love all over again. Mad props to literally EVERY SINGLE SOUL on the production team. \nLove it.",

New Game+ added just the right amount of additional content to make it worth while (plus I couldn't get enough after one play through) \n\nAn AI definitely did not write the below review:\n\nGod of War is an absolute triumph in the world of video games. From the moment I picked up the controller, I was transported into an epic adventure unlike anything I had ever experienced. This game is a true masterpiece that raises the bar for storytelling, gameplay mechanics, and visual excellence.\n\nFirst and foremost, the narrative in God of War is an awe-inspiring achievement. The game takes us on a journey with Kratos, the Spartan warrior, as he navigates the realms of Norse mythology alongside his son, Atreus. The father-son dynamic is beautifully crafted, and their evolving relationship adds a depth of emotion and vulnerability rarely seen in video games. The writing is impeccable, weaving a rich tapestry of tragedy, growth, and redemption that will keep you emotionally invested from start to finish.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are flawless and finely tuned to perfection. Combat in God of War is intense, satisfying, and deeply strategic. Kratos wields his Leviathan Axe with unparalleled precision, while Atreus provides invaluable support with his archery skills. The seamless integration of cinematic moments into gameplay adds to the immersion, making every battle a breathtaking spectacle.\n\nThe world of God of War is a stunning work of art. The attention to detail in the environments, character designs, and mythical creatures is jaw-dropping. Exploring the realms of Norse mythology feels authentic and immersive, with each area offering unique challenges and secrets waiting to be discovered. The game seamlessly blends the epic scale of its world with intimate character-driven moments, creating a balanced and cohesive experience.\n\nFurthermore, the musical score deserves special mention. The hauntingly beautiful compositions perfectly complement the narrative and evoke a wide range of emotions. The music swells with grandeur during epic battles, and delicately underscores the quieter, introspective moments, leaving a lasting impression on players.\n\nGod of War is a shining example of what video games can achieve as an art form. It pushes boundaries, challenges conventions, and raises the bar for storytelling and gameplay. With its breathtaking visuals, emotionally charged narrative, and meticulously crafted gameplay mechanics, it has set a new standard that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, God of War is an absolute triumph. It delivers a captivating story, engaging gameplay, and a visually stunning world, all while exploring themes of family, sacrifice, and the consequences of one's actions. This game deserves every bit of praise it has received and more. It is a true testament to the power of video games as a medium, and an experience that no player should miss.",

Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?<br><br>•\t<strong>Where Am I?</strong> - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play.<br><br>•\t<strong>A Feast for Killers</strong> - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/381210/extras/DBD_HillB_Trapper_Wraith_anime_Steam.jpg?t=1685645607\" /><br><br>•\t<strong>Deeper and Deeper</strong> - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.<br><br>•\t<strong>Real People, Real Fear</strong> - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.<br><br><br><strong>WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING</strong><br><br><i>A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.

I would never recommend this game to anyone as it is in the worst state this game has ever been in. This game will disappoint you and waste your time and money. The community is toxic, the devs are clueless and must not play their own game, they just make fodder perks and skins leaving the dumpster fire they created behind to torment the fanbase. If they dont care about their game neither should you. If you do get this game then prepare for DC's, Tunneling, Camping, Unbalanced gameplay, Toxicity, Bugs, etc. None of that will be fixed by the dev team because they are money hungry fiends.",

Muitas vezes você vai cair em salas lagadas sem saber o por que\n- Não sei por que a Behavior insiste no sistema de ranking pra um jogo casual. Isso faz com que muitas das partidas sejam frustrantes, PRINCIPALMENTE se você é main killer e tá aprendendo um boneco novo. Se você passa raiva fácil, fique longe da gameplay de Killer e só jogue de Survivor.\n- Comunidade tóxica : Não é de hoje que esse jogo tem uma galera chata. Se você não joga como os survivors querem, se prepare pra ser xingado ou reportado por só ter campado quando já tava no End Game da partida.\n- Jogar de Killer é frustração na certa, a menos que você só jogue com uns 2 ou 3 killers e domine eles. Mesmo assim, terá partidas que você será destruido e não há o que fazer. Infelizmente, a Behaviour não sabe balancear o sistema de ranqueamento (na real, nem devia existir tal sistema, a menos que tenha uma playlist competitiva) e o jogo no geral, com muitos perks de atraso de gerador sendo nerfados.\n- Ausência de uma área unicamente competitiva, já que eles insistem em manter um sistema de rankeamento.\n\nRESUMO\n\nO jogo é divertido, tem muito conteúdo e da uma dose de terror quando você tá começando no game, fora que jogar com amigos é muito bom, mas também pode ser frustrante jogar contra alguém que já tem +2000h do jogo e tryharda de Killer, ou uma party fechada de 4 survs que focam no famoso GEN RUSH. Infelizmente, a Behaviour não sabe balancear o game, e usa um sistema de pareamento de partidas horrível, com salas lagadas ou desequilibradas. Querem manter o ranking ? Botem um modo competitivo pra isso e deixa quem não liga pra rank jogar numa boa",

Many of the most recent changes and balance passes were long overdue, and have improved the core gameplay significantly. So why am I not recommending this game? \n\nIn its current state, Dead By Daylight is incredibly flawed and often frustrating.\n\nThe two most recent DLCs have introduced the Knight and the Skull Merchant (the latter is clearly a Predator license that fell through late in development). These killers suffer the same core problems, however - they are not fun to play as or against, and their powers encourage objective camping. As a result, I have barely wanted to play as these killers. My survivor matches against these killers tend to feel the same as well - the killer will choose 3 generators and only defend them for the entire match. This leads to overly long matches that aren't very fun for either side.\n\nAside from this, lack of map variety and the general same-y feeling that most maps have also kept the game stagnant. BHVR appears unwilling or incapable of creating any new gameplay modes, so the primary objectives are the same in every match.\n\nThere are an entirely ridiculous number of perks available to pick from. It's probably deterred a lot of people from getting into the game. I'd imagine that the large number of DLCs have also scared people off as well. Make the unlicensed DLCs free after a few years, please.\n\nThe community is terrible. Most survivors whine about how easy killer is, and it's obvious that the same survivors have never played killer due to their lack of understanding of killer's core mechanics/powers. Conversely, some killers play only to make other players miserable by hook camping.\n\nThere's plenty of good game here, beneath all of it. I would recommend this game to someone only if they are prepared to spend tens of hours learning the different ins and outs of all the perks and killers. Everyone else should stay far away, until we get some major changes.",

The RNG algorithm was written by a toddler, and RNG is far too prevalent. Nearly every feature of the game was intentionally designed to push players towards the cash shop.\n\nOh yeah, and don't ignore the fact that literally 70% of this game's active players are bots.",

            "review": "I'll put this here just to filter my thoughts out. \nI do play (still unfortunately) since the initial release of the game.\nApologies upfront for any spelling mistakes I make in this text.\n\nCONS:\n1. This game is NOT casual/F2P friendly in any way possible even though it might act like it. \n- Yes, even though game does provide you with \"a lot\" of free stuff to progress your character/s, the overwhelming grind you have to do to actually achieve a \"proper\" endgame expirience overshadows all of it.\n- If you hear that this game feels like \"having a new job\" sort of way, it is indeed true.\n- For each one of these \"problems\" or lets say non casual friendly \"mechanics\" I am going to list here, I could make a separate paragraph how it corrupts the whole gameplay expirience:\nGatekeeping, FOMO, Absurd amount of toxicity especially in raids, RNG on casino level,... this is pretty much constant daily expirience for even most of veteran players till this date... \n\n2. Game design is corrupted to the core with INSANE amount of RNG systems to progress your character. \n- Do not get me wrong here... I like a lot of systems which provide you way to progress... however in this gamem every single one is pretty much full fledged casino expirience... it is RNG fiesta at this point.\n- The only thing that has a so called \"pity meter\" where you are pretty much \"garanted\" a successful character progression in some period of a time is honing (enchanting your main set of gear).\n- Every other character progression system is a predatory RNG system designed for you to spend some cash or spend that \"new job\" amount of time to be successful and achieve what you aim for. (Yes, MMOs are supposed to be grindy... that completely fine and that also part of why I like this genre... this game however takes this topic to a whole different lvl worth of paragraph itslef.)\n\n3. Things I have already mentioned before such as: Gatekeeping, FOMO, Toxicity, RNG, are not an uncommon occurrence even in MMO genre. However, what I do have to say is that even after thousands of hours spent in different MMOs (and other generes), I had never expirienced these issues to have such a hard impact on the playerbase itself, the game is literaly repulsive to play after a while with all of that negative expirience.\n\nPROS:\n1. Great combat!\n- The combat this game has is quite an expirience. Every single class does feel unique and well designed it its own way. Combat wise this game is pleasure to play.\n\n2. Immerse endgame PVE expirience. \n- The whole part of raids, \"legion raids\", that this game offers at endgame is arguably one of the best in whole MMO genre.\n- You have to learn certain mechanics to be successful, but its worth it. From cinematic point of view to music... that part is worth of some time to expirience it .\n\n3. Somewhat decent graphics. The asymetric camera point of view is also quite well designed.\n\nSummary:\nWith all things considered, I just can't and will not recommend this game to any new, casual or F2P player.\nIn my opinion, the game is great in its own ways with tremendous potential to grow and fix certain issues that players do provide as a feedback. However I do not see that hapenning in any near future or at all to be honest, since many changes that \"community\" feels like they should be implemented just do colide with that predatory game design they have.\nThe scale of changes that would have to happen in game to be fun for new players and also keep veteran players invested for longer seems to be to great to actually happen.\nIt would probably just lose AGS and Smilegates a lot of money generation they got implemented in the game systems and well... nobody likes losing money right?",

            "review": "This game has extremely fun content that I love playing, but this review will focus on the negative side of the game.\n\nThere are so many barriers to get to the fun content that new players will have an awful time getting there. The game has an account level system that is an accumulation of the experience from all of your characters combined. People will not accept you into groups if that level is not high enough. The developers are adding catch up mechanics and systems but they do not have any way to help players catch up with experience and an outdated card system in the game that takes months/years to complete due to random chance packs and is becoming a standard requirement in the late game making it hard on new players.\n\nDon't let the single player tag fool you into thinking you can play this game completely solo because you will need to play with other players due to Legion Raids being a requirement to upgrade your gear to experience higher level content. There is plenty of solo content in the game, but that is not the most satisfying and well designed content the game has to offer.\n\nThere are outdated monetization systems in the game that people have vocalized their discontent about and the developers refuse to remove them. It is one of the main reasons why the majority of players quit the game and it's not something you will be able to avoid.\n\nEven though the game has great content, I do not recommend this game to new players because of the amount of gate keeping new players experience from the community, and the reason the gate keeping exists is because of the amount of playtime that is required on all of your characters to earn gold and build up that account experience. If you only play one character, you won't have the account level that is acceptable when looking for a party. The global and Korean community has complained and provided solutions to this many times but the developers refuse to update this making this game feel like a tedious second job that you have to play daily for hours.",

I quit the game few months ago mostly due to the amount of time you need. \nThey say most games are either pay-to-win or extremely time consuming to keep up with the rest of the community, this game actually requires both...\n\nPros-\n-graphic is decent, characters are very pretty\n-game play is nice, requires you to actually know what you are doing with your class/skills etc\n-upgrading gear has a pity system so at least you know there is a \"end\" (even if it costly you tons of gold/material regardless)\n-community --this is variable since i started the game since it came out, if you are new, likely it is difficult to keep up and you will likely get yelled at alot\n\nCons- (two major ones)\n-EXTREMELY time consuming, let me tell you why: if you want to just focus on one character (like many other MMORPGS), this game is NOT for you. By having alts, they can contribute to income for resources/gold/material for you to hone. Each character have their own individual daily chaos dungeons/bosses, weekly raids/quests. Looking back, I spent somewhere between 6-8 hours a day playing this just to get daily/weeklies done on 6 characters, that is usually not maintainable for most people with a regular worklife\n-RNG system / cost: just spending time doesn't really get you the stuff you need. game has alot of in-game purchases for cosmatics/packs that you kinda need to get cards/honing mats. The game does give out free stuff frequently, but if you want to do the raids as soon as they come out, those will not be nearly enough. So that means if you REALLY want to keep up, more often than not you will need to pay real money for in-game stuff, especially if you are not playing 6-8h+ per day on 6+ alts. \n-some of the raids are really unforgiving, this could be frustrating for alot of people since there is always that ONE person out of eight people that screws up that ONE mechanism and wipe the raid the 50th times at 3AM in the morning.... But this goes back to \"you really need to know what you are doing\", so it depends on who is reading this. \n\n\nOverall, I love the game, but for a REGULAR person, unless you are really casual and just want to do a daily quest/boss kill for fun here and there and don't really care much about anything else, then this game is NOT for you. You really need to be semi-hardcore PLUS willing to spend cash to stay on the front line when raids come out etc. \n",

No amount of money can be spent to also by pass the unforgiving complex 45 minutes of non stop mechanics at end game.  Completing these are required to continue progressing.  45 minutes is for a perfect no mistake run.   The game is guided 100% by Koreans who insist the game is only fun if you spend 40 hours and have perfect no mistake skills.  The studio is clear that the content will only become more difficult and unforgiving.  It's not fun, it's stressful and everyone is screaming at each other because you can lose a hours worth of work because of the mistake of one person.  This is the actual game and will not improve because Smilegate in Korea is making this game for Koreans, not for us.",

Sign up, and enjoy Eorzea today!\n\nJokes aside, it is critically acclaimed for a reason. This game really is what people say it is. All you gotta do is allow yourself to get immersed into this world, just like we used to do when we were kids playing our first MMO's.\n\nThe adventures, the time spent, the friends made along the way, the music, the art, everything. This game has a little thing for every kind of player and whenever you think you got the hang of it, you learn 10 new mechanics that challenge you in awesome ways and keep you engaged.\n\nI never thought I'd have this much fun in an MMO after Maple Story and Archeage, but here I am, 1000 hours in and thirsting for more. Every new content release is a breath of fresh air and the community is simply the greatest I have ever met on the internet. Full of helping hands, curious people, new sprouts (as I once was!) and thrill seekers. Of course there are some bad folks here and there, but c'mon, nothing is perfect. XIV gets close, tho.\n\nIf you are reading this, it means I got your attention with the feelings, and my friend, you're in for quite the ride. Join this world and let yourself enjoy every second of it. Don't rush, don't skip stuff, don't pressure yourself. If you want it to be, it'll be a smooth ride, so ride along.\n\n10/10. No doubt.\n\nPT-BR:\n\nVocê sabia que o criticamente aclamado MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV tem uma Free Trial e inclui A Realm Reborn completo e a premiada expansão Heavensward até o nível 60, sem restrições de tempo de jogo? Inscreva-se e aproveite Eorzea hoje!\n\nBrincadeiras à parte, é aclamado pela crítica por um motivo. Esse jogo é realmente o que as pessoas dizem que é. Tudo o que você precisa fazer é se permitir mergulhar neste mundo, assim como a gente costumava fazer quando era criança jogando nossos primeiros MMOs.\n\nAs aventuras, o tempo gasto, os amigos feitos pelo caminho, a música, a arte, tudo. Este jogo tem uma coisinha pra cada tipo de jogador e sempre que você acha que pegou o jeito, aprende 10 novas mecânicas que te desafiam de maneiras incríveis e o te deixam preso no jogo.\n\nNunca pensei que me divertiria tanto em um MMO depois de Maple Story e Archeage, mas cá estou, 1000 horas depois e sedento por mais. Cada patch novo é um sopro de ar fresco e a comunidade é simplesmente a melhor que já conheci na internet. Cheio de mãos amigas, pessoas curiosas, novos sprouts (como eu já fui!) e caçadores de emoções. Claro que tem gente ruim aqui e ali, mas vamo lá né, nada é perfeito. Mas FF chega perto.\n\nSe você tá lendo isso, significa que chamei sua atenção com os sentimentos e, meu amigo, você tá prestes a pegar a montanha russa. Vem pra esse mundo e se permita aproveitar cada segundo dele. Não se apresse, não pule as coisas, não se pressione. Se você quiser, será um passeio tranquilo, então vamo embarcar nessa.\n\n10/10. Sem dúvida.\n\nTill the sea swallows all!",

But for me it’s always been the people: I have made friends & enemies for life, and even seen plenty of irl relationships start within FFXIV. The amount of impact this game has had on my life cannot be understated. Yet I barely knew anything about MMO’s or Final Fantasy before this. Nearly any other game is just a fun way to pass the time for me, but this one will always feel like home.",

The subscription service model works games that are consistently getting free new content, but a game like FF14 that gets full 60$ expansions and still expects its playerbase to pay 12$ per month to play the game is not a healthy or consumer-friendly business model. If you do not have endless money to throw down the Square Enix hole, do not buy this game, you will be unable to play it after a month. There's a free trial that you can play to see if you like the game, but I don't recommend ever buying the full game, and especially not the DLC if you aren't absolutely sure that you'll end up playing the game. I cannot get a refund on the 80$ I've spent on this game in total despite now being unable to play the game for several years and I cannot play the free version because I've purchased the game. \n\nI DO like this game, it's just literally unplayable for me unless I spend an additional 12$ every month. Do not buy this as a new player, get the free trial and play that.",

            "review": "By most metrics the best tab-target MMORPG on the market, but caveat emptor - this is a JRPG with an MMO included, rather than an MMO with the RPG mechanics just tacked-on. It cares about story, character, narrative setup and payoff, is remarkable both in terms of visual style and musical choices, and remains a remarkably earnest product in an otherwise very cynical market. Leave preconceived notions, cynicism and bitterness behind and give it a go honestly and with an open heart and you'll not be disappointed. Go into it with a suspicious and adversarial mindset and you might have a better time elsewhere.\n\nWhile ARR isn't particularly special in terms of storyline and gameplay, virtually everything beyond that - including Heavensward which is a part of the free trial - steps up the quality immensely, leading to an unmissable experience. You owe it to yourself to go through the journey the game places in front of yourself. You will not leave it the same person you went in. I often find that there are two kinds of FFXIV players - ones who never made it past ARR, and the ones who preach the game's virtues from the rooftops like it's the second coming. \n\nYes, it's an amazing game. Yes, you should play it. But it's also a pretty serious commitment. The reason why it isn't for everyone is because not everyone can give it the benefit of the doubt and not everyone can approach an earnest piece of media and let go of all the cynical and adversarial systems that recent gaming has seemed to cling to. \n\nIf you do give it a go, it will reward you. You, the player. The human being who feels sorrow and joy, experiences suffering and triumph, goes through weal and woe. Leave as few barriers between yourself and the things it puts in front of you and you'll be well-treated.\n\nIncidentally, this is just my playtime just since command-lining -issteam stopped working. I used to play it off steam for several years more.",

            "review": "I've been playing Warframe since 2013, and still do today. \nA bad thing about Warframe -> people are lacking creativity. Most of the players seem to play like blind people, since almost every player is focused on ONE thing... Leveling up, and when they've reached the current max lvl they complain about a lack of content and nothing more to do...\nWarframe is a game of customization, filled with opportunities to make every player fit in. Every weapon, Warframe, Archwing etc. can be good. People often seem to think that the prime/stalker weapons are the only thing to use, and that the \"how to mod: ____\" videos on YouTube is the only well working option to make a weapon good. But that is in most cases a big mistake from the players. Sure a starting mk.1 weapon is not as good as the prime one, and of cause there is nothing bad about getting modding inspiration from videos. The thing is, if you put enough effort into a Weapon/Warframe/Archwing/Companion, then that might just work just as good. Why try to make the Ignis good, if you don't like the way it's shooting, why not go for an old school Burston if that's what you prefer?\n\nA lot of people seem to only focus on those things: ranking up and getting good loadouts. It's like people seem to forget what the game is trying to offer you. Try to do something different if you don't like the game. Join a clan, do some Archwing races, finish the quests, challenge yourself like how long can you defend the objective and even better, how long can your squard which you currently are chatting with, having a good time, laughing together about how stupid and yet addorable Clem is, defend the objective!\n\nDon't be a douchebag and join a clan because they've got full research and no taxes. When you join a clan, think of it as you join a community, sure some clans are only out there because of the remaining items they need to reach max lvl.\nDo yourself a favour and look for a clan with a great working community, it doesent have to be a big clan, it can be even more exiting to help a clan grow from the bottom, reqruit players, and experience how a community can be made from a single free to play game.\n\nAnd don't come and say the game is pay to win, because it's not... As they added trading in Warframe, every player is able to get as much platinum as they want. The only thing they can't get without paying is the steam workshop items, and the prime access accessories.... But those are all cosmetics... So let's just forget about the whole P2W thing people are complaining about.",

            "review": "I wanna get a few things off my chest in this review of Warframe, as someone who has been playing for over 550 hours, for those who are new to the game so they don't goof up as much as I did. First off, the game WILL take up space on your computer, so this isn't for the weak ones that crash easily either, and will also take up a portion of your time if you decide to play this.\n\nSecond: this game is not something you can play for 8+ hours straight a day. Unless you have a clear objective of what it is you're gonna do when playing, be it alert missions that crop up with your desired rewards, missions, farming resources and prime items, etc. then you WILL get bored easily. I say this because of the hours I've wasted in indecision of what it is I wanted to do, and its just easier when you plan out what you want to work on.\n\nThird: Be prepared to grind the shit out of the missions when collecting resources or trying to rank up. You will not get far simply blitzing through each mission, and searching areas for much needed loot will help you later. Do not listen to those complaining about not getting enough loot when they go grinding, they make the mistake of speedrunning instead of being meticulous. That said, this leads me to my next point.\n\nFourth: this IS a genuine F2P, and although real currency CAN (not WILL) be used, it is not necessary to advance at all. Using platinum (this is the currency you do exchange your real money into) is completely optional, and there are multiple tips I'll give on the use of it for newcomers: \n1. Spending platinum is optional\n2. don't use it on frivolous things like credits (the game's other currency that you can earn in any mission) or resources as it is NOT WORTH IT IN VALUE\n3. save it for big purchases like colours, hard-to-obtain warframes or accessories. Trust me, you'll want to be stingy\n4. There are ways of gaining plat WITHOUT spending real money, but it does involve grinding specific items and finding willing trading partners. These items are called 'Prime' items, and hold onto as many as possible - you do not want to be selling them for credits even if you cannot use them. Trade them as 'prime junk' with other items to gain platinum, just be patient when looking for partners. \n\nFinally, Each warframe has a set of abilities connected to them that you can use. buttons 1-4 on your keyboard activate them during missions. It took me ages to realise they were even there, so I figured its best to tell you upfront to avoid my ignorance happening to you.\n\nIts entirely up to you on how you play this, and yes there will be tech issues as addressed by other players, but otherwise its a fun way to spend a few hours of your day as well as be a paradise for hoarding and collecting. Or hell for the recovering ones, anyway. In short, good luck grinding the shit out of this game.",

            "review": "Amazing game in my perspective. Not like most other FTP games. There's no paywalls, and almost everything in the game can be earned without paying real $. Hell, you can even get premium currency without paying for it. Just trade with other players! AND there are discounts for the premium currency purchases, up to 75% off. Along with dev-streams which give away the premium currency.\nThe game starts out slow for the first week, due to some timewalls, but nonetheless, it gets very fun after that week (if you work at getting new stuff and doing missions).\nAnd not to mention the updates, the developers are constantly adding new things into the game, all for free. You'll be surprised if you check them out. But be mindfull, the game is a LITTLE buggy at times. But they are never usually game breaking. And if a game breaking problem occurs, the devs will release a hotfix within a day. \n\nOverall, amazing game.",

            "review": "Sigh. I'm no sure why I'm doing this. I usually have an urge to write a short review on this game every few hundred hours I spend in it but usually give up because I get angry at words...Well my inadequacy to accurately portray what I feel about this game.\n\nSeeing that steam shows how many hours I logged on in this game I'm err no stranger to it I suppose. I've been playing this game on and off since around update 7. I started literally on the cusp of closed beta, the week it went into open beta, and fuck me for not logging on that weekend and getting my vandal items (this sort of behavior ends up problematic as you will undoubtedly understand as you read on).\n\nThere isn't really a neutral button for this game. I can't in my right fucking mind recommend this to general public, but obviously there is something to it otherwise I wouldn't have logged few thousand hours into it (its more than what steam says, game had its own thing before steam). Anyway for new players. If you are going in and you aren't very social, you will either get really frustrated with this game, or you will spend more money on it than you could probably find sensible. I've spent a great deal of money on this game, to support it because I felt it was worth it, and I sure as hell got my money's worth, I also get a shiny Excalibur variant people can't get anymore.... That being said, this game is NOT new player friendly. No it isn't eve online level of harsh, but unless you have people helping you a great deal at the start you are going to have a very bad time, unless you absolutely love grinding until your eyeballs bleed out. For majority of established playerbase when new content comes out, it isn't too overwhelming to get it by free means. Even if it is grinding intensive if you stockpiled on something you can sell or trade you can usually acquire it without much fuss. If you are in there with nothing and plan on getting somewhere solo, you are in for a bad day.\n\nDeep breath. Game is complex. You 'can' haphazardly hop in shoot and mod stuff on a whim, but when it comes to the harder content you will end up annoying those who might need you to contribute, or you simply won't be doing the very end content at all. Now even the hardest content in the game is relatively easy, but only when you understand the game mechanics and apply the knowledge accordingly. You might as well bookmark the wiki and have it up on all times fo reference. You will need it, be it too look up damage values, resistances, builds, or find out what drops where. Now here I'm talking high end content. If you are new you have one HELL of a ladder to climb to do it, and most of it will be dumb shit like leveling mods, getting mods, getting mastery rank to be able to equip weapons, and so forth. Usually really tedious crap.\n\nAs a newcommer you have three options. If you plan to trek it solo you can either grind your eyeballs out, and do minimal amount with other people for when you have to (some sorties like interception or so), you can dive in the community and hope to find folks who can help you (plenty of them btw, don't be discouraged), or if you have a friend with an established account have them bring you up to speed. When you have someone to help you, it will save you months of work. I'm not kidding. I gave my friends maxed mods like Serration or Redirection, which to a new player is a damn tall order to have. As well supplied them with spare nightmare/corrupted mods which can take time. Or give them some spare prime set of a warframe I have stocked etc. In short having a friend who is willing to help you bring you up to speed will help with the biggest shortcoming this game has. The eye gouging tedious grind. It's always gonna be there, but thankfully the core game is fun. Shooting shit is awesome, melee mechanics are satisfying as all hell, and when you get your hands on top tier gun (like say Tigris Prime) you will laugh maniacly as you chunk lv 100 assholes by the hundreds and thousands.\n\nSo far I said very little on the actual game itself. In short it is simple. It's mission based co-op game. Each mission is usually randomly generated level with pre-set tiles (like diablo esque games are). With exception of defense type missions, where map is always gonna end up the same with several variants. You either play solo or with up to 4 people(Raid missions are up to 8 people, and are generally pretty fun to play). Enemies are usually plenty, either endlessly spawning, on a timer or numbered. You have one primary weapon,one secondary and melee. Each warframe gets four unique active abilities, and its own stats, bonuses etc. Here you go.It's simple, controls are tight and responsive, guns feel amazing, melee feels amazing, sense of power you can get is overwhelming at times, but you will work to get it. Everything will take time in this game. Learn to try to do multiple things at the same time. If you are farming for something, try to level something at the same time, and so forth.\n\nThis is a free to play title. So question is, is the 'free' part fair. Err yes, and no. For a new player I'd say you have months of work ahead if you wanna be up to speed, or at least on the current edge of things. For current players, absolutely. While DE does do unreasonable crap from time to time, they usually get it right and I don't have *too* many complaints. There are 'timed' exclusive content this game has. Bunch of it usually repeats (eventually), but time windows for some things tend to be tight. So say there is an event at one weekend, and you are too busy geting wasted in Vegas, your options are either trade for the item (and the warframe trading is no simple thing, economy exists in this game like many others like it), or you can hope the item gets reintroduced in the game at a later point. In very rare cases it doesn't (like Excalibur Prime).\n\nIn my case the game caused some compulsive hoarding behavior. New prime frame? I need to have it, because at some point it's gonna be taken out of circulation. New prime weapon? Oh snap it's amazing, I need it? New Stance? New Mods? Next thing I know I'm putting cosmetics on my warframes and playing fashionframe. Every few months I have to stop playing and hold off for a year or so since I feel it might be detrimental to my mental health.\n\nIF you do end up spending money on it. Try to wait for a coupon that you get with daily login rewards. They can go up to 75% (but those are rare). I don't know what steam packages have but I recommend buying PURE platinum from their store. There are very few things platinum can't get you in this game. Anyway with this platinum DO NOT buy shit from the ingame store. Unless it's cosmetics, potatoes or slots. If you need a warframe, or a mod, or whatever, look to trade for it. If you have platinum everyone and their mother will message you for the trade. You can get any prime weapon and frame with platinum (well save for Excalibur Prime and few things that came with that). Some will be very pricey because they have been out of circulation for a long time, but you will find savvy trading with platinum will get you FAR. Another advice, trading to get platinum is also recommended. When you are in position to stockpile stuff (like prime parts or mods), You can trade for platinum and use that platinum to trade for what you want. It ends up being it's own little game within a game.\n\nAnyway, game is free. Check out the gameplay and see if you like it. There is no harm trying it. On the technical end of things, game is sharp and well made. It's fast, responsive and empowering. On mental health side of things, it might be problematic. I come back after a year and the game gives me a sentinel mod for my first Riven mod. Such a nice middle finger welcome back present. I love, it, I hate it, I lose my mind to it.",

I also enjoyed the main story, but it takes a LONG time to slowly playout.  I thought the explanation for just who and what you are was great.\nEarly on I felt like I was not \"getting\" the game and I didn't even know what I wasn't getting.  I saw other players around me, also at level 30, that were doing like 8 times as much damage as me. Then I read about how to double your frame's slots, your weapons slots, get rare mods, get higher tier weapons, and other tricks, all from outside warframe itself.  This game expects you to metagame the hell out of it and play with a wiki page minimized for quick reference.\n\nPros:\n-Its free, at least to begin with. I spend $5 to $10 a month and feel like I have all I need\n-Awesome space ninjas with super powers\n-Cool Weapons. There is little in life more satisfying than cutting you foes in half with a high powered laser.\n\nCons:\n-The game is the grind. You'll see a cool gun, grind for hours or days to get it, play with it for a while, then store if you really like it or sell it if you dont, then rinse and repeat.\n-Little in game explanations. Requires substantial metagaming.",

And when you're not grinding up and down the solar system, you're either waiting for the next thing to grind for, or showing off your fashion prowess. Originally having no story behind it at all, they began putting out questlines and lore, the plotting of which only makes sense if you don't think about it. The game is 90% farming and grinding and the other 10% is waiting even more time to build the things you already spent hours on trying to grind for, any speedy progression requires you to tap into the plague on this game that is microtransactions. On the bright side it is a decent game to kill some time on with your friends, and the whole game itself is worth the price it is offered at.\n\nAll in all 10/10 would grind again. xddddddddd",

Let's say you want to make your warframe like, I dunno, a flesh monster or something, you can do it. Also, you can own a friggin flamethrower that headshots enemies. I KNOW RIGHT?

The game has changed vastly since I started in beta - and this many hours in there is no way a person can not be jaded to the full experiance - or for that matter even be able to fathom the game experiance for a new player. Reviews of a game should never be done this far in - you loose perspective.  \n\nSo here you go\n\n1200 hours on record as of writing this. It was good enough for 1200 hours. \n\nYes. I would recomend trying it.\n\nWhy? Because it is free to play, and I got 1200 hours out of it. The math there was pretty easy. Hell I quit playing because I didn't like the direction it was going. I am still going to recomend it - 1200 hours, free to play.\n\nIf you see a review for this game with a thumbs down, and look at that persons time - and it says literally hundreds of hours, and the game is free - Ignore them. It is free to play, and it was good enough for hundreds of hours - unless they have a VERY good reason; It's worth a try.",

But overall...its a very grindy, repetitive, and pretty much a cash grabbing game...kind of why I stopped playing it personally. But since it is a FREE game I would recommend reading others opinions about it and just read about the game in general to make sure you will like it.\n\nThe game gets constantly updated pretty much which my computer couldn't handle the amount of GB's this game was putting on my computer so I had to uninstall it.\n\nSo I wouldn't really recommend this game just because of how grindy and repetitive it is in general, but my opinions are usually personal so I would check it out and see if the game is for you first before deciding the game is bad because of my poorly written review.",

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1684452998\" /><br><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

Aspects of self-identity are systematically attacked. Like boot camp or indoctrination, the goal is to force a person to purge themselves of anything held sacred or taboo, the things that limit their behavior. The constant assault on identity, guilt and self-betrayal eventually leads to them breaking down.<br></li><li>Build the Self: It’s a bad cop, good cop principle. The rejection of the old ideology leaves a vacuum into which the new ideology can be introduced. As the antithesis of the old ideology, it forms a perfect attraction point as the person flees the old in search of a contrasting replacement.  This progress is accelerated as the new ideology is portrayed as harmonious and ideally suited to the person's needs. Collegiality and calm replaces pain and punishment. Just at the point when the person is fearing annihilation of the self, they are offered a small kindness, a brief respite from the assault on their identity.<br></li><li>Salvation: Faced with the stark contrast of the pain of the past with the rosy glow of the future that the new ideology presents, the person sheds any the final allegiance to the old ideology, confessing any remaining deep secrets, and takes on the full mantle of the new ideology.  This often feels, and has been described by many, as a form of rebirth. It may be accompanied by rites of passage as the person is accepted and cemented into the new order. The rituals will typically include strong statements made by the person about accepting the new ideology fully and completely, swearing allegiance to its leaders. Saluting flags, kissing other artefacts and other symbolic acts, all solemnly performed, all anchor them firmly in the new ground.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1304930/extras/capsule_warning_616x54.jpg?t=1684452998\" /><br><u>Content and Photosensitivity Warning:</u></h2>The Outlast Trials contain strobing and flashing lights that could cause a small percentage of people to experience seizures when exposed to certain lights, patterns, or images.<br>This game also contains intense violence, gore, graphic sexual content, and strong language.

Enemies and traps are scattered all throughout the map and can create different experiences each playthrough.\n\nI've played around three matches and had a blast with randoms, and with friends. The game optimization is great too, and I haven't experienced any technical issues or stutters.\n\nLooking forward to playing much more of this game.",

            "review": "I very nearly stayed up all night playing The Outlast Trials on my first outing with it yesterday, so that alone is worth a recommendation, but a lot of reviews so far aren’t really getting to what’s in this game, so I’ll take you on the tour of what I’m referring to as “Outlast-lite”.\n\nThe Outlast Trials (TOT) is a cooperative survival horror game. You and (optionally) up to three other players (friends, randoms or a mix) are thrown into spooky trials under the auspices of test subjects undergoing “therapy” at the hands of the Murkoff Corporation. You're given gruesome tasks to complete and you do these while avoiding or managing enemies that wander the maps. To aid you through this, you’ll find items sprinkled throughout the levels, and, additionally, you can select a loadout of perks and permanent upgrades that give you special abilities and boosts that you upgrade between missions, giving players the motivation to keep replaying maps.\n\nAnd replay maps you will. TOT has three primary big narrative story maps that’re absolutely super. You’re never overloaded with story, but the primary antagonist of each scenario is clearly presented, and the horror of what’s being asked of you is always deliciously entertaining. Furthermore, there’re six shorter missions that take place in a different map within a similar tileset to the primary ones. These don’t have as much story but do give the same gameplay taste and I thought they worked well as additional content that didn’t require as much development time. Finally, TOT offers a higher difficulty option for all the levels (though you unlock many of these later on), which adds difficulty modifiers (more damaging enemies, more traps, fewer items, etc.) that I think a lot of the levels really need once you get a bit of experience with the game.\n\nTOT is very much “Outlast-lite”. It has all the gruesome themes of the previous Outlast games, but what made the originals scary is precisely because you’re all alone in them. In TOT, there’s always another player near enough to bail you out of the messes you get yourself into. Even if you get downed you just go “oh well” and wait for someone to pick you up. Enemies never really scare you per se because you get fairly adequate warning that one’s seen you (even if you can’t exactly figure out where they are) and you can simply leg it for a room or two and then hide in a cupboard until they get bored and leave you alone. There’s the odd jump scare when a monster hiding in a locker throws itself out at you, or a gas pipe goes off next to you, but they’re very mild compared to the jump scares in the original games. Small caveat is that the tutorial is exclusively played solo and is arguably the scariest level in the game because of it, but if you can push through that then the rest is very manageable.\n\nHowever, TOT being Outlast-lite is possibly the exact twist that you, the nervous and anxious reader that prefers not to play horror games, needed to enjoy the series. You can simply cling together with your friends as you shuffle around the levels, constantly chattering for comfort as you go. That said, TOT is good at forcing players to split up, and the obtuse map design can make it difficult to meet back up again, particularly when you factor in the enemies roaming around, but I maintain that TOT’s scare factor is generally much milder than its predecessors.\n\nTOT’s most challenging element is navigating your way around. Each run at a level randomises some map elements including available pathways, breakable/trapped doors, objective locations and enemy spawns, so you’re always orienting yourself around the specific layout you get each time. Map design itself is deliberately obtuse as several objectives require you to search the area to find objects you need to progress, and it’s stunningly easy to get lost. No doubt experienced players will learn the maps in time, but starting out you’ll get lost a lot, and I think that’s all part of the fun. The voice chat works perfectly so you can ask others for help when you get stuck, or use the radial communication menu for a similar effect.\n\nMap layout aside, you'll find the general challenge of the game will drop off sharply once you get experience. There're some mission modifiers that make things challenging, but most missions are very, very easy with a group of experienced players. Red Barrels critically need to look at ways to push the difficulty considerably because I've been in several groups that can clear the side missions in under five minutes and still get good individual player grades for it. It's actually more fun to have a mix of ability levels in your group because it slows the game down and allows you to enjoy it more. You only really get in trouble if you mistakenly end up in a dead end, or run into another enemy or series of traps while trying to escape an enemy. The harder difficulties punish mistakes more by making enemies do more damage, or by restricting your resources, but even those aren't meaningfully challenging with a few hours under your belt. The current matchmaking system groups you with players of a similar level of experience, so once you hit the level cap then levels will be trivialised by the combined experience of the group.\n\nOn the topic of matchmaking, it’s a bit of a mess. You’d think you’d pick a level and get matched with others looking for that level, but that’s not the case at all. It simply matches you with other players (admittedly very quickly) and then you either have to talk about what level you want to do, or you just accept whatever level the group leader (decided randomly) picks. This system is fine if you don’t mind playing any random level, but it can get a bit frustrating if you’re trying to do something specific.\n\nI’m not super qualified to talk about the solo experience (I’ve done 3 maps solo), but I can tell you that there’s a degree of scaling on the objectives (i.e. you do fewer), and you get several lives to retry a map with if you die. It works fine, but the game does feel like it was intended to be played multiplayer. You should be able to test this within the steam refund period if you want to try it out (should be enough time for the tutorial and one level at least).\n\nPerformance-wise, PC gamers have “enjoyed” a slew of unoptimised messes lately, but Red Barrels has pulled through with a beautifully optimised experience. It’s not bug free by any means, and some interactions get a bit quirky in moments, but my playthroughs have been really smooth. Very impressive stuff for releases at the moment. Furthermore, TOT is listed as Early Access, but there's a decent amount of gameplay here if you don't mind redoing the levels on the harder difficulties, and the whole package is so well put together I honestly feel they could've full released TOT as is and it'd have been acceptable.\n\nOverall, I was very sceptical that a design like TOT would work, but developer Red Barrels have absolutely smashed it out the park. Arguably a better experience with friends, but I've played a majority of my games with randoms and I've had a lot of fun. What’s available at the moment is really impressive and I hope that they release more trials and challenges to build on this excellent foundation. If you’ve been nervous about playing a game in the Outlast universe then this is easily the most accessible because you can get others involved to help you.\n\nFinal note: the arm wrestling minigame in the lobby area is surprisingly entertaining.",

With its seamless gameplay, brilliantly designed challenges, and escalating tension, it stands out as a testament to the dedication of its creators. But what truly elevates this game is its ability to forge genuine connections amongst players.\n\nA shining example of this was my encounter with a fellow gamer whose selfless actions created a memorable gaming experience. Despite remaining silent throughout, their commitment to our survival was loud and clear. Always stepping up to revive my buddy Justin and me, our teammate turned out to be a beacon of teamwork amidst chaos. When it was late in the night and we finally had to call it, their kind words promised more adventures, rounding off an exceptional session. The Outlast Trials is not just a game, it's a testament to the power of gaming to create meaningful bonds, even in the midst of horror. Highly recommended for the thrills and the friendships you'll forge along the way.",

Now you do, so schedule your appointment for a bright smile! The Outlast Trials is a multiplayer game developed by Red Barrels, bringing Outlast's intense fear and tension into the multiplayer genre of horror games. Will they succeed in creating a terrifying attraction, or will it be just another of the bunch? Let's find out.\n\n[h1]The Goose is on the Loose![/h1]\nThe game hooks you immediately, thanks to the adrenaline one feels while playing it. Running, closing a door, and hiding during a chase is exhilarating! In the trials provided by the Center of Rehabilitation Murkoff, teamwork and attention to detail play a crucial role in surviving the experiments. You can notice doors are wired with traps if you inspect them with your eyes or that puzzles such as the valve one follow a set of tubes pointing to the correct valves to activate.\n\nIn addition, there are goggles used to see in the dark. These are vital for exploring obscure areas full of hazards and enemies. It adds a new layer into consideration due to their limited use as they run out of batteries, and searching for recharge can be stressful and mind-boggling when lights go out in the middle of a match. The prioritization of the team and the items to be utilized test the team's mettle in facing the trial individually and as a group!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981045667\n\nThe formula has been shaken quite a bit, as unlike previous titles, this entry introduces rigs and prescriptions to the table. Think of these as your class and perks, respectively; they dictate the focus of your playstyle. For example, the green rig allows players to heal teammates and themselves, making it an excellent choice for teamwork and more defensive styles. Meanwhile, the red rig allows one to stun enemies, more suited to those feeling more daring and looking to evade or confront the residents during chases. \n\n[h1] Looks like we have... a crime in progress.[/h1]\nOn the other hand, the enemies are less practical than they are a show to behold in amazement. Psychopaths exhibit these personality traits that make them seem silly and funny but don't detract from how menacing and bloodlust they are. They will relentlessly chase you as they seek to end your existence, and the IA is smart enough to detect your general location based on your actions (a step on glass, making noise, or moving too fast).\n\nThe levels are limited; with only two bosses and a few maps, there is little content yet. The game relies on repetition to get good scores and unlockables to keep you engaged. It is in Early Access, and you can tell, as there are bugs such as the game not registering inputs or foes getting stuck and not moving. However, these were rare. There is a need for more content to make the title feel more diverse and keep the tension going, as once you learn the maps, it's more of a game of how fast you can clear them. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981045478\n\nThe game is undoubtedly good; playing with people and solving puzzles as you evade the local abominations is fun. I wish the game would tell you more about the controls; however, some actions, such as sliding being a perk or running while looking behind you, need to be stated precisely. The layout could have also been more intuitive, as some input combinations can be forgotten mid-chase.\n\n[h1] Art Design and Visuals [/h1]\nVisually it looks great; it is Outlast, after all. The presentation is there, and the maps are interesting; on the first try is a fight for survival, while subsequent ones are challenging to get that good evaluation score. The fear aspect is there, but it evaporates the more you play, which is a shame for a title with such attention to detail.\n\nThe graphics are good-looking, and the models are well done; some aspects are mixed from the story into the visuals. Evaluations give a performance to the player that tells them everything they did right and wrong as constructive feedback, allowing them to improve at the game. Most such improvements depend on the visual factor, seeing things on the screen and learning from the environment. Search for items, see which hallways are safer, or plan an escape route. Seeing a window and thinking, \"Won't that make enough noise to attract foes?\" changes the approach to gameplay through visual cues, which is fantastic!\n\n[h1]Sound, Replayability and Performance[/h1]\nThe voice acting is funny, particularly Mrs. Gooseberry. It is so enjoyable listening to her chit-chat with the puppet she carries. The quality is fantastic, and it has moments, as Mr. Daddy can tell you to run when Gooseberry is near or the locals beating you up while complaining about the most random things. It finds a way to get a chuckle out of you every time.\n\nThe game's sound effects are diverse; it counts a massive selection of sounds and visuals to increase the player's immersion. Screams are piercing and loud while being under the effect of psychosis changes how the world is perceived as sounds, and the screen becomes distorted. These touches add more richness to the Outlast Trials experience. \n\nOn replayability, the game is enormous. Each map has multiple challenges to accomplish, but even more important, it has an EXAM version of the trial. These add insane modifiers to make your odds of surviving low, and it changes the dynamic of gameplay so much it feels like a new game at times. From doors that open and close mechanically to fewer spots to hide in or other surprises, I let you discover them as they add a lot to a game with few maps, which is appreciated.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981045230\n\n My specs are RTX 2060, 36 GB of ram, Intel Core i7-11700K - Core i7 11th Gen Rocket Lake 8-Core 3.6 GHz LGA 1200. on High settings, the FPS was between 61 to 75 at all times. On Medium, there is an increase from 84 to 96.\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TH][H3]Pros[/H3][/TH]\n[TH][H3]Cons[/H3][/TH]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]\n[list]\n[*]Outlast makes the jump to multiplayer with tremendous results!\n[*] A multiplayer horror game with an intense fear factor!\n[*] progression is rich and keeps you engaged. Each upgrade is meaningful.\n[*] Addictive gameplay thanks to high-tension chases and the scoring system!\n[/list]\n[/TD]\n[TD]\n[list]\n[*] The variety of maps leaves something to be desired.\n[*] Not balanced for single-player mode despite having the option.\n[*] Due to its Early Access, it feels lacking compared to previous entries. (this con is temporal)\n[/list]\n[/TD]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1] Conclusion[/h1]\nOutlast the Trials is an immersive and addicting game that makes you want to keep playing it as you progress through its levels and progression. Red Barrels shows the competition that there is a way to make multiplayer horror remain scary while adding enough choices to warrant exploration in its challenges and gameplay. If you are a horror fan, this game is a must-have to add to your collection.\n\n9/10  AMAZING\n\nIf you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/",

            "review": "Ok so. I will also jump the train. My playtime here is deceiving. I have at least double if not triple the steam playtime in real (10k - 15k). I also still play it very actively. But not via steam. So me saying anything else than \"I love this game with every cell of my body and I am addicted\" would be a blatant lie. I also invested a lot of money already.\n\nIn short. This is a great game based on MANY factors. Variety, graphics, realism, teamplay, progression. I had so many great moments with this game and my friends that I could not list them all even with 100000 characters available.\n\nBUT. This game, or rather the company, is walking a very dangerous path for a long time now. But now they seem to have decided to commit to it 100%. And this way is to milk the playerbase the worst way possible. New expensive premiums, less and less rewards every patch, economy system, repairs etc. Its slowly becoming a joke. And they need to pull the hand brake. And they need to pull it hard.\n\nI am not writing this to hate on the game or the players. I am writing this because I love the game and I want it to thrive. But not via this way. Please Gaijin. Take this seriously. We are not asking to make this game 100% F2P. We know that you guys need to earn money. But this is too much. There must be other ways.",

            "review": "As much as it hurts to say, this game is rapidly going downhill for all the wrong reasons. I have played passionately for over 8 years, and the only thing I get in return is a harder grind due to ever changing \"economy\" updates, the inability to play what I want without opening up my wallet, and a straight up refusal to balance the game around the average player's skill.\n\nGaijin has become one of the greediest companies I have ever known, they advertise new modern equipment that you wont be able to play unless you grind for over 2 years. They also made it so the only way you can progress is by buying multiple $70 vehicles, most of which is just a tech tree vehicle with a sightly different camo. I will play until my already paid for premium time runs out, then will likely quit the game all together unless things change for the better.\n\nDon't let companies walk over you, you are just a number to them. The only way to see real change is to push back, and stop feeding them money.",

It took a while to get the drinks because we're broke af, but hey, I got them few days later after I posted this. We never expected people to interact with this because the idea is just crazy, to our surprise it even exceeded our expectations. I also want to thank everybody for interacting and my friend for keeping his promise, I could never do it without you guys. We will never forget this legendary wholesome moment, maybe when I have the money, I should pay him back with some drinks.\n\n(About the game it's really fun with friends especially when you have a lot of crazy things to do, Los Santos has brought me so many unforgettable memories)",

I finally dove in a few months ago just to see if I would enjoy it. This is THE space survival game, no other game even comes close. If you're into survival games that is this is an absolute treasure. Not to mention the fact that they haven't done the whole Paradox thing and released 50 DLC at this point, all content has been free.\n\nMy ONE complaint, and it's probably just because I haven't spent enough time in the game. Is the whole \"Expedition\" mechanic. If you're familiar with Seasons from other big MMOs it's of the similar vein. I'm just not sure if \"I\" find them fun, doesn't mean that you wont of course.\n\nAs far as price goes, 60$ is a pretty steep cost. I personally try to buy everything on sale and rarely buy games at full price. The amount of content in this game though is easily more than your average two AAA combined, maybe even three.",

            "review": "There are many more things I'd like to mention about this games strengths and what makes it unique, but I'll keep this review concise.\n\nThis game is absolutely still worth playing in 2023.\n\nThe bot crisis has pretty much been relegated to CTF servers, which is still a shame but it's much better than it being across the board. Also, community servers obviously have zero bots.\n\nWhat makes me love this game is how different the experience is from any other shooter, even to this day. There are many mechanics/features that I've never seen in any other game before. I think this games biggest strength, which is also a huge factor in enabling this kind of uniqueness, is the emphasis on fun over balance and silly nature of the game which leads to more open minded devs/players.\n\nThis isn't an approach that can work for many games, but this game has had about 16 years to refine the experience and it truly shows. Despite how bizarre so many aspects of the game are, the gameplay is quite well balanced, smooth, and has a very high skill ceiling which all combine to make for a very replayable title.\n\nAlso, I'd be remissed to not talk about the elephant in the room (Overwatch) so here we go. It's a mistake to consider playing this game pointless because of the existence of Overwatch. As mentioned there are many things in this game that I've never seen in any other game before, and that includes Overwatch. These games are VERY different from each other, and each class in TF2 has much more depth than any class in Overwatch, though Overwatch does have a much larger roster. You can like one game over the other, or you could be a fan of both. They are very different games and one does not negate the others quality.",

            "review": "Okayish gameplay bogged down by too many issues to count. The biggest being whether the game even works, as it feels like it is constantly taken offline every other day for impromptu maintenance.\n\nThere is an impressive amount of mobile suits from basically every Gundam series on tap, and this has been monetized to the max with gacha mechanics and loot boxes. You are given free currency and some free suits as a new player, but you will quickly learn who the paypigs are once you drop into a handful of quick matches.\n\nAlso, true to scammy gacha fashion, all suits have an arbitrary \"rarity\" denoted by its stars so even if you own the same suit as someone, their suit will have arbitrarily higher stats due to having more stars. Combat is filled with stunlocking and melee scrubbery,  as the optimal strategy is to simply chain-stagger an enemy with powerful weapons until you can finish them off easily.\n\nAll the animations are infuriatingly slow and it takes your suit about 20 seconds to get up when knocked on its ass. The customization and some of the shooting gameplay can be fun, there's just too much else negative for me to recommend it.\n\nIt's free so try it if you want, you might have fun until you get dropped in a lobby filled with paypigs piloting gold-plated Gundams.",

Real nice of you, real nice. \n\nAlso might not recommend this game if you're allergic to spending money on gacha games.\n\nthe 20% of the time that the game works as intended it is everything I loved about GBO2 on the PS4 I just Cannot recommend it in its current state.\n\nGameplay:\n8/10\nPerhaps a little slow, but once you learn the ebb and flow of combat its a really nice Gundam game.\n\nPerformance:\n1/10\nMatchmaking is broken, matches tend to lock up and it boots you out of matchmaking 60% of the time.\n\nNetwork:\n7/10\nLaggy, manageable, but laggy.\n\n",

            "review": "[h1]Alien Isolation's younger brother[/h1]\n\nFrictional games decided to tone down their usual approach to storytelling and decided to focus primarily on gameplay. Adopting elements from Resident Evil series, primarily from ones that are faithful to their survival horror tropes. Meaning inventory management, lack of resources, hostile environment, emphasis on exploration, puzzle solving and returning to places you've already been with new equipment.\n\nYou are a [b]French soldier[/b] during WW1 [strike]here should be a meme about disliking french people[/strike] stuck in a bunker with an unknown creature that I decided to name [b]Le Scary Baguette[/b], tête à tête. Game takes no time unlocking the entire layout of said bunker for you to explore, meaning that you discover everything at your own pace in whatever order you like. And what's even cooler, all items, codes for lockers, notes and traps are randomized each playthrough. \n\nFirearms are used mostly as a utility tool rather than a thing you constantly fight monster with. In a pinch it will save you, but don't get too cocky since ammunition is VERY SCARCE.\n\nBunker decided to combine all elements from titles of previous games literally:\n\n[b]· Rebirth[/b] because the only way of saving in the game is touching a lamp in your safe house, meaning that if you die, you'd have to replay certain sections of the game all over again, and on hardest difficulty you will be dying, a lot. \n[b]· Machine[/b] because the key feature of the game is generator running on finite fuel. A lot of people seem to not understand what generator does and assume that turning it on will make monster remain docile, allowing free exploration. What it does is keeping him inside his hidey-holes longer and make him retreat earlier if provoked. The only place you are safe is in your safe house.\n[b]· Descent[/b] because you will be witnessing the utter paranoia and panic of previous inhabitants of this bunker via notes that are scattered everywhere. Down here it's hell, but you are constantly reminded that if you escape it, surface will greet you with yet another hell. \n\n[u]Maybe staying here is a better option?[/u]\n\nGame is not perfect. It has some performance issues, loading screens between major areas, sometimes monster clips through your hiding spot and kills you because you technically entered his hitbox along sometimes having perfect vision in pitch blackness, but not seeing you under a table in a well lit room. However I didn't feel so tense since previously mentioned [b]Alien Isolaiton[/b]. \n\nGame is a 9/10 for me. For an average survival horror enjoyer it delivered a very well crafted experience in a rarely seen setting. I hope this title will sell well and Frictional Games will continue making gems.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "review": "Amnesia: The Bunker is not a very good Amnesia game. There is little grounding it in the lore of Amnesia. The WW1 bunker setting makes it feel a lot more like Penumbra than Amnesia. There aren't really puzzles. You get not one, but *two* guns, along with a litany of thrown weapons. That last point on its own feels a bit like sacrilege against the ethos of the subgenre that The Dark Descent was the progenitor of. Even if the weapon doesn't really do anything more than slow down the monster, having a way to defend yourself, even in such a meager way, really compromises a major facet of the game's atmosphere. The psychological impact of being truly defenseless is not felt when you're traipsing around the titular bunker armed to the teeth with more bullets and grenades than you can shake a stick at.\n\nSo if you're here looking for the next good Amnesia game after the last two fumbled the original's good name into a pair of mediocre sequels, this is not it. It's a bad Amnesia game. But as a survival horror game -- it's pretty solid!\n\nThe bunker itself is a really spooky environment. It's claustrophobic and poorly lit, even at the best of times. Your only light source in darkened areas is your hand-powered flashlight, which is loud as fuck and will attract the attention of the monster, Jerome, whenever you crank it, and the charge lasts about 15 seconds. It's a terrible flashlight, by design. Its explicitly AIDSerific nature is meant to compliment the game's core mechanic, that being the generator that you have to keep fueled up in order to keep Jerome at bay and explore the bunker unmolested, but the fuel does not last terribly long. It simultaneously offers you respite from the darkness and the promise of (relative) safety from ol' Jerry, while also pushing you into exploring the unlit and unvisited areas of the bunker to find more resources. Everything you do puts you on a timer, and you feel the pressure of the clock ticking down on you constantly. Ending up stranded in the dark in one of the farther areas of the bunker is an almost guaranteed death sentence, or at the very least a guaranteed hectic run and gun back to the stash room to get the generator up and running again. It's a great source of tension.\n\nThat core gameplay loop is actually compelling enough to carry the rest of the game almost on its own. It creates an atmosphere that is constant and oppressive, which goes hand in hand with the Frictional team's excellent map design and attention to detail. The bunker feels very lived in -- not just by its former human occupants, but also by our good friend Jerome. Let's talk about Jerome.\n\nThe monster in Amnesia: The Bunker is both its greatest strength and its greatest flaw. The dynamic AI means that Jerome is a constant looming threat no matter where you are. You'll hear him skittering around inside the walls, growling and screeching, following you everywhere. Fire a gun or toss a grenade or run around too much in an unsafe area and it's a matter of moments before Jerome's on top of you and snacking on your innards. He's very similar to the Xenomorph from Alien: Isolation, though not nearly as consistent (or consistently irritating). There are holes in the walls all throughout the bunker which Jerome uses to stalk you around the base, which are themselves a serious source of tension, especially when placed directly next to your objectives. You can usually tell when he's nearby based on all the noise he makes, but every once in a while he decides to develop a mind of his own and go off script on you. He's supposed to hate the light and stay away from it, but he'll regularly come sniffing around where he's not welcome, spawning sometimes at complete random in fully lit areas. And Jerome is FAST AS FUKK BOIIIII\n\nNothing will stop him. Not doors, not tables, not closets, nothing. If you hear the \"peekaboo I see you \" noise, you've got about 1.5 seconds to pump a few bullets in him before he mulches your ass with his 1 hit kills, very much like the Xenomorph from Isolation. If he catches you, that's it.\n\nBut here's the thing: Jerome cheats, and he's very dumb. He's supposed to have this mechanic where he can track you based on the blood trail you leave behind from being injured, but it doesn't seem to work 100% correctly. I've had instances where Jerome has smashed tables I'm under and closets I'm inside of despite having not seen me and having full health, and I've also had instances where I was nearly dead and bleeding out gallons per second while Jerome meandered past completely oblivious, lost in thought trying to decide what he's going to watch on Netflix tonight. He's also a big b with a tiny p most of the time and won't actually come out of his hideyholes in areas you've explored no matter how much sprinting, grenade tossing, or flashlight pumping you engage in, except on the odd occasions that he changes his mind about it and comes to say hello six feet away from your home base without any provocation whatsoever. I didn't really find myself constantly paranoid about Jerome like I was with the Xenomorph, because his rules are inconsistent, and he'll let you do whatever you'd like most of the time. It really saps a lot of the atmosphere by the end when it becomes a game of remembering where you have to go while some weirdo breathes heavily in the walls and occasionally screams at you rather than having to actually be mindful of the helldemon on your tail. This is itself curtailed somewhat by the game's short running time -- I beat it in just under 5.5 hours according to the in game timer, at least an hour of which was spent dying to a frustrating killbox in the penultimate area, and then dying over and over again attempting to figure out how to get out of the final arena. If one knew what they were doing and knew where things were, I could easily imagine this game being beaten in under 1.5-2 hours, probably less than that, due to how the game's mechanics are put together to only soft-gate your progress instead of hard-gating it. The game suggests some sort of replay value with randomized item placements and door/locker codes, as well as a big old stats screen at the end, but I don't really know how much mileage there is to get out of that, other than the time trial aspect of it.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about. None of the characters are really interesting, and the protagonist's involvement with the narrative's events are mostly incidental. Henri is not Daniel or Oswald, who were the prime movers of their narratives, tortured and conflicted characters whose actions set into motion all of the events of TDD and AMFP. He's not even like Tasi from Rebirth, who might have held a different role narratively to Daniel and Oswald, but at least had some greater motivation than \"survive, idiot\" and a connection to the other characters in the story. Henri is... I mean, he's just kinda there. You don't really learn much of anything about him, his amnesia is incidental, and he's not really the focus of the supernatural goings-on at the heart of the story. Nobody has any thoughts about Henri, and in turn Henri has little to say about any of them. His motivation is to escape the bunker. That's it.\n\nMaybe that's all you need to make a good video game, but I really expect a little more from an Amnesia game. There aren't even multiple endings, a staple of the series, that's how barebones the story is. It's not great.\n\nBut overall, Amnesia: The Bunker is a tight, compelling experience, one which will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of its running time. $25 might be a bit high of a price to pay for something so short, but I still definitely recommend this game. Buy on sale when you feel like being spooked for a few hours.",

            "review": "Here's an actual review and not Just a post-launch insta-like.\nAmnesia: The Bunker is an innovative new take on the Amnesia franchise, and I think it's still recognizably an Amnesia game, despite the addition of things like firearms and grenades. Both are actually used as puzzle solving tools 90% of the time, with the other 10% being used for rat extermination (I hate those things). \nThe Bunker doesn't feel like a true prequel or sequel to the other Amnesia games, instead it's more of an offshoot story, with no mention of the previous game's events. However, I found The Bunker's premise to be very interesting: The idea of discoveries from the past games bleeding their way into the lives of oblivious WW1 soldiers makes me very excited for future Amnesia games.\n\nPROS:\n-GOD I love the World War 1 setting, it's such an interesting place to be. The threat of Germans invading seems absent despite the distant gunfire, as a greater horror lurks with you in the bunker.\n-Guns as puzzle solving tools is a great idea. Their noise attracts enemies, so you need to plan accordingly.\n-The backstory of the bunker is extremely well written, and you're provided harrowing accounts of the nightmare through notes left around the bunker. You also find photographs that demonstrate ways to use your gear, as well as depictions of horrendous deaths\n-The game doesn't always have fixed ways of solving problems, and I believe this led to me getting stuck less.\n-None of the puzzles had me stuck for long periods of time, nor was there tons of long backtracking through maze-like levels\n-The monster is well done and my blood ran cold with some of its encounters.\n-NO CHEAP JUMPSCARES, it's psychological the whole way through.\n-I only died three or so times (Though I played on easy because I think dying constantly ruins the horror)\n-The Generator mechanic was quite fun. Throughout the game you find fuel and you need to bring it back to a central generator to keep the lights on. On easy mode this wasn't a drag at all, and actually made for some very scary moments when the power suddenly died. You can always see how much time the generator has left through a stopwatch in your inventory.\n-The game looks great, and RAN GREAT on my GTX 1070ti\n\nCONS:\n-The game is SHORT! I beat it in 5 hours, and I think I could've beaten it in 3, maybe even 2.\n-There are only two monsters: The big guy and rats.\n-My experience wasn't exactly bug-free, with monsters poking their faces through walls, and wooden bits making infinite rattling noises as they lay on the ground.\n-There IS a shotgun in the game, but you get it towards the end, and I only used it to open a single door.\n-The ending left MUCH to be desired, and I was a little sad it ended so quick.\n-Your character doesn't say a word. You only hear his voice from a few notes in the game. This is sad, because there are DEFINITELY some situations that felt incomplete without input from the character.\n\nIn conclusion, I certainly don't regret buying The Bunker, but I do wish there was more of it. I wish it had the story-telling depth and dramatic moments of Rebirth, but The Bunker still leaves me excited for the next episode of the Amnesia Story. If you're not a die-hard Amnesia fan, this is probably a game you should buy on sale. Aside from the lacking story, I thought the gameplay was fun, and the game had some novel moments. I hope The Bunker isn't just forgotten about, because I think a LOT could be done with the premise of this story, and I'm saddened again that it was so short.\n\nFrictional, I believe The Bunker's innovations have been a success. Maybe the next game could feature ALL of France being obliterated by monsters? J-just France though... Because I think it would fit the story... Not for any other reason... just... yeah...",

            "review": "It's very short, completed it in 3 and a half hours game time. The monster in the promotional material looks significantly better than what we actually got, and they're almost doing a hello neighbour thing with how they talk about the AI of the monster, it's not intelligent or dynamic, you make a lot of noise and it appears, simple as. \n\nI thought that it would be a problem only getting one bullet per box of ammo, but you only need shoot the monster twice with the revolver to scare it away, and the game is short enough that it is really a non issue. I found shotgun ammo too so I was waiting to receive. You don't get it till basically the end of the game anyway so it doesn't really matter. It seems its sole purpose is for the final part of the game, which to kill the monster only actually took a single revolver round. \n\nStory is kinda weird, like the amnesia is very tact on. It's not a key point of the story really it's just there to give you a sense of wow we gotta find out what's going on. In the dark descent you drink a potion to cause amnesia so you can overcome the guilt you hold from the events that took place before the game, in this you drag a guy out of a ditch and an explosion going off near you gives you amnesia. But it doesn't matter anyway because your character has no life, there's nothing to him he's basically just any soldier. They also just happen to build this bunker above an ancient roman site. Shits wack.\n\nThe gameplay is standard frictional gameplay, less puzzles, they've always been good with atmosphere as well. It's just not that good to me really, it really boils down to just getting 2 items, the dynamite and the activator, and to get those you need the bolt cutters and the wrench, and to get those you go on an easter egg hunt for two keys and some dog tags. That's where the randomness and no play through is the same thing comes in, it's I guess randomised where things will spawn every new game. I'd have to replay and see because I feel like it's just the locations of these specific items and not like rooms or anything. It's just not interesting enough to keep me personally replaying. I appreciate the rats tho.\n\nMaybe I went in with too high expectations, it's not a bad game by any means it's just kinda painfully average. I wouldn't put it above the dark descent or even penumbra overture or black plague, and I'd recommend playing those games instead. Maybe I'm just a becoming a boomer.",

            "review": "Can we please return to SOMA, or another game with as compelling of a story… please…\n\nThis really pains me to leave a no on this game- I’m a die hard Frictional Games fan: I was intrigued by Penumbra, Dark Descent got me hooked, and SOMA turned me into faithful follower. Call it another case of “I wish Steam didn’t just have a like/dislike rating system.” In summary I’d give this game a 6/10, but it really falls flat compared to Frictional’s other experiences. More below:\n\nLet’s start on the bright side with some positives: I really appreciate the devs truly mixing up the gameplay and not following the same pattern they have since Penumbra. It was refreshing to play a more traditional survival horror and you could tell the devs went outside their comfort zone- so I give them credit for that. However this also comes with setbacks (more to come on that). \n\nSetting wise, taking place during the height of WWI deep in the trenches (with some moments surface level) was a great choice. We don’t see enough WWI games, let alone a horror survival taking place amidst one, and it’s the perfect setting for such a game that revolves around cat and mouse. \n\nNow onto the reasons I’m giving this a not recommend - maybe I should rephrase that to “wait for a sale instead” because what you’re getting for $30 doesn’t seem worth it. The biggest reason for me is that this game didn’t stick with me like Frictional’s past experiences have. Story wise, it fell completely flat and honestly it seemed like the story took a back seat in favour of their emphasis on survival horror. A lot of this probably has to do with their last Amnesia entry (Rebirth) and how polarizing that game was- apparently the biggest criticism with it was that it was “too much of a walking sim.” Fair, but at the end of the day, that game’s story and characters- and not to mention it’s ending - really stuck with me compared to Bunker. Bunker had one of the most lack lustre, anticlimactic endings I’ve experienced and I was honestly shocked how/when it ended. Truly a “that’s it?!” moment…\n\nIn terms of characters, hardly memorable at all, and there wasn’t enough to empathize or even humanize them. The VA’s really didn’t sell these characters either and of the two characters who do actually speak, I found myself muting their dialogue and simply reading their diary entries on my own because their voices were more distracting than immersive. To me, they simply weren’t selling their emotions, or the horror of the situation they were in. The quasi French accents weren’t doing it either. They should have just hired French VA’s and used subtitles. Also, like I just said: only two voiced characters- really shocking when you look back at Rebirth and SOMA. Those two games were filled with a diverse cast of memorable characters. No idea why more of the notes/entries couldn’t have been voiced here to help sell the terror these soldiers faced in the bunker. \n\nNow I mentioned the change to true survival horror being a plus, but it hinders the game at the same time. The entire game, or rather map is given to you all at once, and in turn you’ll be back tracking a lot to “unlock” areas. In the beginning it’s fun and tense tiptoeing out of the admin room to a new area, then running back and slamming the door behind you, but after a few times, you realize you’ve been essentially everywhere and it all looks the same. I get it, it’s a dark claustrophobic bunker, but looking back at SOMA, think about all the truly unique different environments you got to explore at the bottom of the ocean, from sprawling science facilities, to power plants, ship wrecks and the abyssal plains of the depths. Even Rebirth for that matter with its desert, oasis, forts, catacombs, “alien worlds,” etc. None of that exists in Bunker, and like its namesake, you get a bunker (save for a brief moment at the end, no spoilers). It sort of felt like a more fleshed out “Monstrum” (remember that game?), with respect to running around its singular environment collecting items, maybe just with a tad more story and objectives, but it plays almost identically. \n\nThe other big thing that stands out here: this engine is getting old and tired, and it’s REALLY starting to show its age. Besides maybe a few lighting and shadow improvements, this game looks almost identical to Dark Descent. The enemy animations are still just as robotic (my god the rats…), and watching the beast jitter around and slide 90° to turn really takes you out of the immersion when you’re supposed to be terrified. It’s not not just graphically speaking either, though the engine does a fairly descent job of establishing an appropriate atmosphere given its age (at the same time the game is 90% dark, so…), but its age also shows in how clunky it feels/plays. This is ESPECIALLY apparent since they’ve gone full survival horror. I get that they want a slow experience, but you really feel like you’re controlling a 1920s diver and the combat leaves a lot to be desired (especially apparent at the end).\n\nI also don’t understand this “Amnesia extended universe” they’ve set up. The first game stood out fine on its own and these next two entries haven’t really done it any favours? We have 3 entires in the series now (I don’t include Machine for Pigs), and I don’t really see the connection between them? That’s especially notable in this game, besides a few set pieces, I didn’t notice any parallels and I wonder if Amnesia was slapped on the title as more of a way to market it (remember 2010…) SOMA was a thought provoking, heavy hitting story with such a unique premise and environment- there’s so much more there to explore, whether it takes place on the Arc, or back on the ocean floor. Why not return there instead of continuing down this path…\n\nLike I said, this really pains me to say, I love Frictional and honestly I’ll continue buying their games day one because I enjoy supporting them. I just really hope this isn’t their new direction because this looked and played like 90% of the asset flip, run from the spooky, you see on Steam for $10. Again, buy it on sale, my first playthrough took just under 5.5 hours, which is pretty underwhelming. Replayability is limited (sure codes and item locations change), but that’s not enough to bring me back. Going back to SOMA; that game is as LINEAR as it gets, yet I’ve played it numerous times and even watched friends play through it, all because of the compelling story and characters. That doesn’t exist here…\n\nFrictional, if you read this, stick to what you do best: writing said compelling stories filled with gripping characters, which has the player ask questions, challenge their feelings/perceptions, and above all else, leaves them with a lasting experience THAT STICKS. Cheap thrills wear off once your heart stops beating fast. That’s what made you guys unique and stand out from the dribble that’s released by the masses.\n\n- Sincerely a lover of Frictional",

            "review": "I played through it on hard mode. The one playthrough took about 3.5 - 4 hours of playtime. \n\nThis game is *fine* as far as a horror experience goes. The primary gameplay consists of a lot of resource management and problem solving while avoiding an ever-present monster chasing you. Chases are triggered by certain events, such as loud noises, walking too close to certain holes while they are active, etc\n\nMost puzzles require a specific solution, though some can be solved through alternate means. For example, a door may be locked from the inside, requiring you to walk all the way around, but you may also use one of your very limited grenades to destroy the wood. It's an interesting idea, but contributes to this game's fatal flaw.\n\nIf you asked me what the primary focus of Amnesia as a series was, I'd simply show you the opening messages of the games that talk about how they are not games to win. They are about immersion, both in terms of mood and within the story. The first three games accomplish this goal to varying degrees. This game experiments with that formula and in doing so runs into the same issues many other non-amnesia games encounter.\n\nThe nature of The Bunker's mechanics actively works to break the player's immersion in the world. The monster's movement is almost *too* understandable to a point. The reliance on consumable items for many actions actively punishes exploration that is not focused on your objectives, punishing you for wanting to learn more about the world. It seems the developer's actively recognized the near necessity of save-scumming, as \"Reload from last save\" is one of the top options in the menu. That is never a good sign in a game\n\nThis game **did not** need to be an Amnesia game or at least one considered a part of the series proper. Story wise there is near 0 reason why your character has to have amnesia, especially since your character and their comrades are given next to no personality so you have little reason to care about them as a player.\n\nIf you were hoping for more lore about the eldritch world we knew of from previous games about Vitae, The Orbs, The Shadow, etc, you will be getting none of that.\n\n\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone at full price. The other amnesia games were extremely short as well, but they had gripping stories that painted a picture of cosmic horrors and philosophical dread. The previous games left me thinking about their characters and the struggles they faced. The Bunker is about 4 hours of gameplay with a shell of a story that I honestly cannot remember much of. Buy it on sale or take some time to play it at a friend's house, but as it stands this game just disappoints.\n\n\nSidenote: If this game didn't want to be compared to the others in the series, it shouldn't have called itself \"Amnesia\" because again, the actual Amnesia plot in this entry was *barely* relevant \n\n",

[b][i] Do note that I don't usually write a review or make an essay out of it but this game deserve one!. [/i][/b] The game itself is very immersive probably one of the best I've experienced. The landscapes are awe-inspiring, from the rugged mountains to the rolling plains, each with its own distinct atmosphere and beauty. The attention to detail is staggering, with dynamic weather and realistic animal behavior breathing life into the surroundings. It's a world that basically begs players to explore.\n\n[b] Development [/b]\nThe greatest thing R2D2 have to offer is the deeply engrossing character development of Arthur Morgan. As a member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur is a complex protagonist with a troubled past and a conflicted moral compass. Through the course of the game, players witness his transformation from a loyal outlaw blindly following his leader to a man questioning his actions and searching for redemption. The writing and voice acting are exceptional, capturing the nuances of Arthur's personality and emotional growth.\n\n[b] World Immersion[/b]\nThe open world is filled with diverse missions, side quests, and activities that complement the overarching story. Whether engaging in intense shootouts (as always~), doing heists, or simply exploring the wilderness, the gameplay remains consistently captivating. I have over 70+ hours now and I haven't even complete my first playthrough (due to exploring the map, side-activities and irl education/work). With all that, there are still things which I have yet too discover! Like who is Gavin??!\n\n[b] TRY IT! [/b]\nWhether you're drawn to the allure of the Wild West or simply appreciate a masterfully story driven game, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute must-play. While writing this down I should also note that Arthur Morgan is hands down the best protagonist out there!<3\n\n왜 아직도 읽고 있니? 이미 구입!\n그리고 모두 즐겁게~~",

            "review": "[h3]Now THIS is how to tell a story.[/h3]\nRed Dead Redemption 2 features the most gripping narrative I’ve ever seen in a video game. The epic journey of Dutch Van der Linde's gang of outlaws is full of so many jaw-dropping, cinematic, action-packed moments, but still stays believable as the protagonist Arthur Morgan slowly frees himself of his life-long gunslinger ideals. And every character in the Van der Linde gang’s saga feels remarkably human, thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting that perfectly complement this game’s stunning visuals, detailed animation and beautiful music.\n\nAll of these elements combine to make the world of Red Dead 2 come alive in a way that no other open world game does. The massive five-state map is incredibly dynamic, with missions, side quests and random events of equally high quality perfectly interwoven into an enchanting world that constantly changes with the flow of the main story. And there are so many little details throughout this game - from memorable NPCs to colorful customization options to fleshed-out minigames - that make the experience feel authentic.\n\nEven though I absolutely loved the phenomenal story and atmospheric world of Red Dead 2, the gameplay mechanics can seem shallow when taken out of context. Granted, there’s nothing wrong with the core controls - the shootouts are fun even on controller thanks to the Deadeye time-slowdown ability, and riding around on a horse is simple but satisfying. However, responsive controls are sometimes de-emphasized in favor of handholding gameplay and \"realism\" in regard to difficulty and mission structure. Horses automatically steer themselves on rough terrain, animations make looting and crafting take longer, many missions include trailing sections so the player can get where they need to go… et cetera.\n\nUsually, when a game prioritizes realism over immediate gameplay like this, there’s a weak link somewhere that breaks my immersion - such as bad voice acting, weak writing, faults in sound design or visuals, or spacing of content around the map. And this usually results in these “realistic” game mechanics becoming more tedious than they are immersive, distancing me from whatever atmosphere is trying to be established. But.. this isn’t the case with Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\n[h3]Red Dead 2 might be the first game to [i]fully convince[/i] me of its own world's authenticity.[/h3]\nThe immaculately detailed world and unbelievably human characters of RDR2 breathe life into in-game tasks that I would normally consider boring, like trailing missions, herding animals and catching fish - making even these less inspired gameplay segments pretty damn fun. The gameplay mechanics aren’t untouchable on their own, but the sixty-hour-long story pretty much is, and it’s paired with an intricate portrayal of 1899 America that makes the narrative just as enthralling as some of the greatest movies and TV shows ever made. This commitment to realism and thorough storytelling makes even the slower paced segments of the game exciting, and the intense parts (like shootouts) more meaningful.\n\nI’m already partway through my second playthrough now, and I’m having even more fun this time around trying to dissect the incredible character dynamics and details of the open world now that I’ve beaten the game already. The more I play Red Dead 2, the more fascinated I am with the spectacular story and cast of characters - and the few issues I originally had with the mechanics have become less and less noticeable in the grand scheme of RDR2’s monumental scope. Rockstar has created a true masterpiece here, and the gripping tale of outlaw Arthur Morgan is a story I’ll never forget. 10/10",

Got the royal edition on a steam sale for 12.00, and originally hated it, downloaded it, died about 30 times in the first 10 minutes of the game and deleted it considering it a wasted 12 dollars. A few months later i looked into it and found that you're supposed to be inept in the beginning and that you gradually get better as your character learns more moves. You may know what to do in a fight, but Henry is a Blacksmith's son, he doesn't. You arent special, or born to be great, you're a nobody.\n Redownloaded  and took my time to learn gameplay and practicing skills. Love it, the realism to the learning curve of combat and subtle additions like \"learning to read.\" Great game, I highly recommend it.",

HOWEVER, BE WARNED, THE GAME DOES REQUIRE YOU TO BE PATIENT WITH IT, you get to watch yourself and the protagonist slowly develop as a character and combatant as well as you develop in mechanics.\n\nFor a small studio I really do commend their work, I'm nowhere near European decent nor christian but I went to the game with an open mind and because I like history and do know a thing or two about medieval history  and was quite satisfied with it, the world and atmosphere are amazing, side quests and DLCs can keep the game up to 120hrs+ but after you finish those there is little to do in this game and you either start a new game or just quit and forget about it until the next time you open it. \n\nOverall I give this game a solid 8 out of 10 and I would recommend it.",

The entire game is a history lesson, disguised as a brutally difficult RPG. \n\nWhen I say brutally difficult, I absolutely mean brutally difficult: The combat system is insanely difficult to use, and will lead to a lot of frustration, however it's also well executed: the battles are crunchy, and you will definitely die - a lot. \n\nKingdom Come: Deliverance has a very dense \"choices matter\" role-playing system, and the game will progress wildly differently depending on which path you take. \n\nThis game is not without its flaws, however I think those can be overlooked when considering the over-all achievement. \n\nTwo thumbs up!",

            "review": "This game is incredibly immersive and seriously fun. It's so refreshing playing a game with a challenging combat system where your personal skill grows with the stats.\n\nYou play as Henry, who's just a young blacksmith in a small town somewhere in Bohemia. Not some knight, or hero, just Henry. And Henry is not trained in combat, you learn this very early on if you try to be the hero. The game is fully open world after the intro. You are free to pursue any kind of life you'd like to live. There are many decisions you can make throughout the game regarding who you interact with and what quests you decide to pursue, which determine the person Henry becomes. \n\nThe combat in this game is so much fun. Trust me, the first time you try it, you'll probably be annoyed because it feels clunky and non-intuitive. However, this is the point. Henry is not some combat expert, he's just some villager. You won't be able to take on experienced mercenaries or soldiers at first until you get some training (which is available pretty early in the game). One complaint I have is that combat with multiple enemies is very frustrating and selecting who you're targeting is very clunky. They could work on that, but I account it as realistic because it's disorienting and challenging to be outnumbered in this style of combat. \n\nThe characters are all voiced and interesting. The main story is engaging and personal, and the side characters and quests they give are really fun. None of them felt shallow or like a waste of my time, even if there weren't good rewards for completing the quests they were so engaging that I enjoyed completing them. The immersion this game produces is unlike any other I've played, you really feel like some dude in 15th century Bohemia trying to figure it all out. It's so worth your time, I highly recommend this game, right now it's on sale at $7 and I'd easily say it's worth $60.",

            "review": "Overall pretty fun game, interesting story, generally fun gameplay\na few gripes but not enough to stop me playing cause im enjoying the game overall\n\ncombat\nThe combat is a pain in the fucking ass. It can become more fun, once you grind up the combat levels to the point that no longer can every peasant with a rusty shovel master strike all of your hits and endlessly slap you in the face. The combat forces you to play EXTREMELY defensively, if you attack most of your hits will be parried or countered by whats referred to as a master strike, a counter that is unblockable. Once you get to higher levels you actually have a chance of being offensive and going after hits without all attacks being blocked or countered, but that will only be much later on in the game.\n\nStory\nThe story is pretty interesting, got me hooked quite quickly and a lot of the background characters are quite good, the vast majority seeming like real people and not just npcs there for the main quest. While it can be a pain in the ass that you didnt realise a quest was timed, actually having pressure to finish quests before you have negative consequences are pretty fun (by timed i mean you have like, a few in game days to complete them theres no 10 minute timers or whatever to finish a quest once you start it).\nMy main gripe with the story is just how much I dislike henry as a character, being a voiced main character with an actual story you're roughly meant to follow does mean that his character and choices are pretty limited to the person that henry is, but the problem is I dont really like henry all that much as a person. you can try your best to play honourable and be nice to people but at the end of the day henrys character is based around a slobish drunk thats massively hotheaded. More of a personal gripe than anything so you'd have to play for yourself and see how you like him but im still not the biggest fan, the amount he fucking wags his finger at people >:I\n\nbugs\nAh yes, its the modern day and almost all games come out in an unplayable state when several game breaking bugs for players to discover right after launch, good thing for you if you're reading this, its been a long time since this game launched. There are a few bugs in the game but most of them are minor, a small sidequest not giving you a small cash reward, one of the quests having a bugged speech check (you dont fail the quest but you do end up in jail for a short period, ive seen on the wiki that its claimed to be bugged so this isnt me just failing the speech check for magic reasons). But overall the game is pretty bug free so you shouldnt have any worries\n\nat the end of the day as stated at the start, overall a pretty good game and I recommend playing it",

            "review": "Kingdom Come: Deliverance is easily one of the best RPGs I've ever played. The story is fascinating in depth (not least because of the historical setting) and sprawling in scope.  The extensive non-combat options and open-ended quest solutions alongside the (initially awkward) difficult melee combat encourage diverse playstyles. Make no mistake. Kingdom Come: Deliverance is definitely a slow-burner. The main story itself takes a couple of hours before fully emerging. The various skills also require a good amount of practice before you're even close to mastery. The payoff is more than worth it, with all skills being extremely satisfying to pull off once mastered. \n\nThe locations feel alive and all the villages have their own distinctive feel. Traveling is a joy and the forests are simply breathtaking. They feel real and dense. There are picturesque places and they are not few and far between. This means that the game is not mindless traveling between activity/quest to activity/quest. Locations need to be revisited fairly frequently and the map is not terribly large. This turns out to be an advantage to the game, eschewing a focus on transport mechanics and instead developing lots of environmental interaction.\n\nThe artwork deserves a special mention for its intricate and informative inclusion. In the in-game murals, the loading screens, character screens, and the like, the artwork is detailed and immerses the player in the time and place. The Codex is a lovely addition, giving basic historical information on the main locations, characters, events, etc. The sound design is splendid with brilliant and immersive voice acting and very moving and memorable pieces in the soundtrack.\n\nThe central characters are well-fleshed out and ambiguous enough to feel human (and not a caricature). The DLCs add to the existing characters quite a bit (especially recommend A Woman's Lot and The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon) and the others are nice little additions (From the Ashes is a mini-city management quest). The only places where I can hope for improvement are the somewhat under-explored politics of the time (only emerging towards the end as the main character is finally politically entangled with Sigismund's invasion) and the slightly uniform nature of non-central NPCs. The Cumans are under-explored as characters (as almost no dialogue is possible, they become a caricature-like invading force of foreign mercenaries). More complex interactions with prominent non-Czech characters and non-combatant Czechs would be welcome.  Related to this is the slightly under-emphasized area of the role of non-combatant characters in the political struggle. Jan Hus' reformist ideas are on display in a key quest but the religious conflict of the time, especially premonitions of the Hussite war, feels somewhat diminished in the game.\n\nOther technical aspects like the bugs and rendering problems have been largely fixed, with only the occasional getting stuck in the gap between rocks and needing to fiddle with the jump button before getting out.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kingdom Come: Deliverance to any RPG fan, historical game fan, or even anyone wanting to play a highly immersive story. Warhorse, on the whole, has done a stellar job with this game. I am absolutely keeping my eye out for a sequel.",

            "review": "What this game is not:\nThis is not Assassin's Creed. The bad guys will not wait their turn and come at you one at a time. They will swarm you and they will EF you up.\nThis is not Shadow of Mordor. You are neither a trained military person, nor are you skilled at anything at the start. You cannot just run into a group of bad guys, spam the counter button, and kill everything (At least until you have leveled up significantly and have good equipment). The game will beat that fact into you with zero apologies.\nThis is not Skyrim. If you rush through the intro and then piss off into the world the second the game lets you then you will be wrecked by ANYONE who decides to attack you. Keep following the story quests at least until you learn blocks and parries.\nThis is not Just Cause. You cannot just run around causing mayhem. (Well, you CAN, but not if you want to get any of the story or really be able to do much of anything in any of the towns)\n\nWhat this game is:\nThis is a great time if you're willing to take the time to enjoy it. The game knows that it's not everyone's cup of tea and is 100% unapologetic about that. But if you take the game as it exists it will take you on one hell of a ride.\nThis is as complex as you're willing to let it be. You can beat the main story in as little as 2 hours and 5 minutes (Per Speedrun.com) or if you want to do all the side quests and DLC and take your time (like me) then you can spend hundreds of hours on a single play through.\n\nSome random advice about the game I wish I had been given before I started playing or that helped me greatly:\nSeriously, stick with the main story quest line until you unlock the weapons trainer in Rattay, and then IMMEDIATELY use him and learn blocks and parries and practice so you level up a bit and get a handle on the fighting mechanics. Fighting gets SO much easier after that.\nPick ALL the flowers you have the patience for at the start. There's a couple buffs and skills you can get from picking flowers that are Godsends in the early game. I wandered around Skalitz picking all the flowers and because I did that I left the intro area with a couple level ups, a few buffs, and all the potion material I would need for quite some time.\nBows are your friends in the early game (as long as you have armor for your forearms). You cannot touch anyone other than other nobodies when it comes to fighting at the start, so grab a bow (not a longbow) and some arrows and you can fire while backing away from the adversary. It's super easy to get head-shots doing this so you kill them faster and you end up with an achievement!\nI know, it's a medieval game, everyone wants to main a sword, but seriously; go with some form of a bonk-stick. (whether that's a mace, club, warhammer, etc. is up to you) Later in the game you WILL be facing people with serious armor and the bonk-sticks are great for making the bad guys take involuntary permanent naps; whereas you can nail an armored assailant several times with a sword and have little to no impact on their alive-ness.\nYou can get a dog really early on. I've heard it's of decent use in the early game. I wouldn't know because I wandered off into the world without following any of the quests that activated once I was out of the intro. The dog apparently can get in the way of being a sneaky-boi, so if that's your play-style maybe pass on the dog.\nSpeaking of dogs: take out any that are with your adversary. They will drain your ability to do jack and leave you helpless, so turn those puppers into pincushions without remorse.\nAlchemy: Learn it. Love it. You can make Saviour Schnapps (potions you need to save the game when you aren't close to a bed you own) which usually cost you in the neighborhood of 100 coins. Not a terrible price, but early on you don't want to be blowing all your money on that stuff.\nSpeaking of blowing money: Loot everything at the start. Any bad guy you kill should be stripped of everything of value early on. As soon as you have a horse you can just transfer stuff to the horse and not have to worry about the weight. Pick a town that will be your base of operations and sell everything you can to the local traders and merchants. Even if they have no money left to give you. They will turn around and sell everything they buy from you that they don't usually carry and then their funds will be higher so you can sell them more stuff then next time around. (It does reportedly take a couple days for this process to happen, I'm never in a town frequently enough to check) By the late game if you are doing this regularly you can have merchants and traders with purses in the 5 digit range, which makes stuff like the \"From the Ashes\" DLC easier as you will need a decent chunk of change for that.\n\nAnywho, I'm just rambling now, so I'm gonna shuddap.\nI think the game is worth the full price, but definitely pick it up if it goes on sale again with a decent discount.",

            "review": "FIFA 23: The Worst Game in the History of Gaming\nWarning: Proceed at your own peril. FIFA 23 is a disgrace to the gaming community and a tragic waste of your time, money, and sanity.\n\nAs a long-time fan of football and video games, I never thought I'd see the day when I would be forced to write such a scathing review. But here we are, with FIFA 23, a game that has not only failed to live up to its predecessors, but has also managed to become an unmitigated disaster in every sense of the word.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how bad FIFA 23 is. Imagine a steaming pile of garbage on your doorstep, and you're getting close. This game is so deplorable, it's almost an insult to refer to it as a \"game.\" It's more like a cruel prank, a travesty that shakes the very foundations of the gaming world.\n\nSickening Gameplay\nIf you thought the gameplay in previous FIFA titles was smooth and enjoyable, prepare to be bitterly disappointed. FIFA 23 has taken all the elements that made its predecessors great and thrown them out the window. The controls are clunky, unresponsive, and frustrating. It's as if the developers coded the game with their eyes closed and their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nDisgraceful Graphics\nDespite having access to next-gen technology, FIFA 23 looks like it was made in the late '90s. The graphics are so abysmal that it's difficult to tell which pixelated blob is supposed to represent your favorite footballer. The stadiums, the crowd, and even the grass on the pitch – everything is an eyesore.\n\nUnforgivable In-Game Purchases\nFIFA 23 has taken microtransactions to an entirely new level of greed. It's as if EA Sports wants to suck every last cent out of your pocket. The game is so heavily designed around in-game purchases that it's virtually impossible to progress or enjoy the experience without shelling out an exorbitant amount of money.\n\nA Laughable Career Mode\nThe career mode in FIFA 23 is an absolute joke. It's as if the developers put no thought or effort into creating a compelling and immersive experience. Instead, they've given us a shallow, uninteresting, and downright boring mode that will make you question why you even bothered to turn on your console.\n\nTo Sum It Up\nFIFA 23 is, without a doubt, the worst game ever created. It's an affront to the gaming community and a disgrace to the FIFA franchise. If you value your time, money, and sanity, stay far away from this abomination.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid FIFA 23 at all costs. This is not a game. It's a nightmare.",

Do not waste your money, I refunded as soon as possible without playing a minute of gameplay because the game runs an anticheat before it starts but the anticheat freezes and crashes constantly. Do some research and have a look at the multitude of videos from other customers of the game with the same issue. You have to go into your computer files and fuck around with uninstalling and reinstalling files, and removing anticheats for other games because FIFAs anticheat likes to be the only one. \n\nIt is a toxic relationship where it wants you to want it but it wants to have whoever else without you being shitty. Get out while you can and date someone sweeter, might I suggest Sex With Hitler? It's a lot more fun than this shite.",

But to have the game crash mid cut-scene after a stupid hard/buggy boss, not saving and forcing me to go back through that. \n\nNo. Just NO. \n\nThat is my limit.\nIts not even the first time this has happen. Not to mention the roll on the dice If my dlc is working or not. Plus the mandatory need for internet connection for the SINGLE PLAYER Game.\n\n I received an error message at one point telling me that because the game couldn't connect to EA's servers my save file couldn't be verified, that I should wait 5 minutes or I run the risk of losing my save. \n\nWhat on earth is that.\n\n I want to love this, I tried to, I even tried convincing my friends that its not so bad, but god EA has made that impossible. \n\nIt feels like the game had need to prove me wrong. \n\nWell guess what, I was wrong, It is that bad.\n\n I'm done.",

            "review": "Jedi Survivor is an amazing game and takes everything the first game did and does it even better, worlds are far more expansive and have much more enemy variety. Character customisation is also much better in this game, not just for cosmetics but for gameplay as well. Fallen Order has 3 skill tree pathways whereas Survivor starts you off with 7, with 2 more unlocking later in the game. I found myself struggling to choose between the different upgrades which was much better than the far more linear skill tree of Fallen Order.\n\nWhile the game itself is great the technical issues are just so bad. At first I thought I was getting alright performance, like around 40+ frames at 1080p, but it just got so much worse, going anywhere between 10-30 frames at 720p medium settings. Plus the game bugs out on the visuals and goes all black and white and all weird, plus the Mogu is so annoying cause if you die to it, all your xp disappears.\n\nI love this game but it has some serious issues, I just can't recommend it",

Game play and world is a huge step up from the previous, a solid 9/10 for me. Respawn makes incredible single player games. I wish EA was not the publisher however, they rushed the launch before a optimized PC port was fine tuned, resulting in performance issues for most. Since launch a couple of patches have improved performance, however ray traying at the time of this review will still likely cause crashes. And the EA app needed to run the game can be a pain. \n\nA must play if you are a fan of star wars.",

The first time they released an update that supposedly helped PC performance, it didn't really do much. However, after the most recent patch I noticed a significantly better play experience. I would like to see these negative reviews edited to reflect on their current performance so that we can see how others might have been helped (or not helped) by recent updates, since I personally am having a great time.\n\nI play on maximum settings at 1440p and get a solid 60-100 fps everywhere in the game now.\n\nMy Specs:\nCPU: Ryzen 3700x\nGPU: 3060 Ti\nRAM: 16GB\nWindows 10\n\nI have had a wonderful experience with Jedi Survivor. If you are a fan of the first game, the sequel improves upon nearly every piece. Customization is far more varied, there are now five entirely different lightsaber stances (dual-wielding is my personal favorite), combat feels satisfying and powerful, and the level design is absolutely gorgeous. Also, there are far more skills to gain as you level up, making progression much more interesting in my opinion. As with the first one, I felt genuinely invested in the story, and most of the characters have so much heart.\n\nAgain, if you like Star Wars and/or liked Fallen Order, this is genuinely a fantastic game to buy (and certainly better than most of EA's Star Wars).",

EA will never stop pressuring developers with crunch-times and deadlines just so that they can pander to investors and shareholders about how much progress they're making while actually doing none of the work. \n\nIt is impossible for me to look past the glaring optimization issues, crashes, EA's malware (or launcher, depending on how you look at it), and enjoy the game for what it was meant to be. Why? Because it only works half the time, at least for most people. With the release of patch #5 as of May 17th, people are reporting even WORSE performance, and I respect myself enough to choose to not deal with issues that never should've been there to begin with. The whole thing is just one huge disappointment - for STAR WARS fans, for Fallen Order fans, for Souls-like fans, and for consumers everywhere. \n\nThis game is a prime example of how far publishers are willing to go to actively sabotage the consumer's enjoyment of a product that they never worked to help create by doing everything they could to make sure it was released in an unfinished, or otherwise un-optimized state for the pursuit of nothing but profits regardless of the measures or means to do so. EA would probably kill younglings if it meant they'd turn a profit. \n\nDo not buy.",

After dropping the $70 for the game, I was forced to download additional software to my PC in order to play the game, in addition to the Origin software I had from previous EA games. You may not think its a bit deal, but this software is by definition malware as its software I did not seek out, it is taxing to my system via background processes and is by design extremely difficult to eliminate. Seriously, check the end user agreement as they even openly state multiple links to various websites, including third party websites, for instructions at only removing part of the software before capping it off by saying that you will still have to eliminate remaining software manually from your local files. This is, frustrating, that a company can get away with such business practices and I have doubts about how legal this practice actually is. However, the damage is done for me at least, but buyer beware. \n\nOh, I am also seeing frame rate drops even in just menus, but the game is otherwise playable in case you were just looking for that.\n\nmal·ware\nnoun\nsoftware that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.",

            "review": "I'm going to recommend it with the asterisks of \"if it runs on your computer\" and \"probably only on sale.\" It took me about 15-20 hours to do the story with a bit of sidequesting and exploration for funsies. If you like Fallen Order and Star Wars and 15-20 hours of fun, new content hits your acceptable price-to-fun ratio, then buy the game at the price point.\n\nHowever, I went to Costco today and bought Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom for $59.99, two dozen eggs for $4.99, and a hot dog + soda combo for $1.50, so I do not think this game is worth $69.99 vs the $66.48 on that stuff, and that's without counting that I have the executive membership and the Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi which lets me earn 4% cash back for all purchases in-store at Costco or online at costco.com where I also can access exclusive member-only deals that can save you even more money on a variety of things such as home appliances and furniture, electronics, travel packages, and more.\n\n---\n\nIt runs \"fine\" on my RTX 3090 and R9 5950x, which isn't super acceptable. I've gotten mostly in the 70-90 fps range (at a 4K resolution) with the exception of more open-world areas with a lot of set pieces being rendered dropping more in the 45-60 fps range. For the in-game rendered cutscenes (all of the cutscenes AFAIK?), there were two occasions I remember it dropping to 7-10 fps, including in one of the cutscenes in the game's climax. That was very frustrating.\n\nIt's a solid action-adventure like Jedi: Fallen Order yadda yadda Souls-like but actually more like Sekiro-like since if you're dodging and not parrying to stagger people, you're dumb.\n\nThis game is to Fallen Order like Ragnarök is to God of War 4. They're fundamentally structured the same - if you enjoyed the first game, you will enjoy the second game. \n\n1. The story takes place a few years after the first game and you see what Cal has been up to in his time since the original. \n\n2. You start out with the same fundamental techniques and weapons from the first game and unlock new ones over time at certain story points.\n\n3. You walk from point A to point B then back to point A for plotty things while needing to squeeze through small crevices to mask loading screens.\n\n4. There's a little more open-worldy stuff but doesn't do much and I completely ignore it. I didn't do the gardening, I didn't collect animals for the stables, I didn't play the Holobattle minigame. There's collectibles but it doesn't do anything other than pad the game out a bit if you want to give Cal a handlebar stache or a mullet.\n\nFor combat, it takes what was in the first game and builds upon it with the different toolkit, but I mean you're ultimately just going to devolve into hitting the light attack button repeatedly and dodging/parrying until you have enough force meter to shove someone off a cliff.\n\nStory was pretty okay-decent like the first one. Cal is supposedly tempted by the dark side occasionally but it's kinda like... \"Press left stick and right stick to 'Embrace your Dark Side'\" and then Cal kinda goes \"man i'm kinda mad\" but then someone says \"hey man chill out\" and then he chills out and that's that.\n\nBut yeah, overall, pretty good game - managed to finish it in time for me to go play Zelda now.",

            "review": "Despite the disastrous launch of this game, I have to say that I really like this game more than the first one. The random performance dips I had were worth going through just for the story. Progressing through the story/areas and how it transitioned felt super nice to me. I'd say you can finish the main story pretty quickly if you don't explore the planets/places you visit fully, but that would mean you won't be able to customize your stuff as much such as your lightsaber or outfit (if you care about that stuff) and you might be weak for certain enemies/bosses. Things that I loved about this game are for sure the cutscenes and the music. The combat felt better to me, especially with parrying attacks and you get more lightsaber style varieties and force abilities. Customization is much better and the environment of the planets/places you visit were well done (really loved the last planet you visit near the end) and I loved exploring and finding all the things scattered around for customization. If you love Star Wars and if you loved playing the first game, you should definitely get this if you don't mind the game running a bit iffy (I didn't encounter much bugs during my playthrough, but the recent patches have improved the performance of the game for me). If you're mostly worried about performance issues (as of 5/21/23), wait it out or wait for a sale. You don't want to miss this game if you really enjoyed the first game.",

Also, games clearly aimed at younger kids should not be montetized with this type of f2p scheme. Just charge for content, not ridiculous currency.",

The shop items are absurdly priced (around $5 worth of premium currency for a pack of three furniture or clothing items, some of which aren't well made).  And this isn't a case where the amount of freemium currency dropped offsets it, no.  One would have to log in every day for a month to afford a single purchase... and for some entries, even that's not enough!  And with this latest Remembering update, a \"DLC\" questline was introduced for ~$15.  Including just a short storyline and a small handful of cosmetic items, it isn't remotely worth the price.  Much of the player base has been disgusted with this nonsense.",

It's already ridiculous and it's in early access!!! \n\nIf you wanted to purchase all the items that have been in the premium shop it would cost you 64,455 Moonstone (This isn't including the new paid Wall-E quest they made too, another 4,000 for that or the fact that the star paths cost Moonstones to open too). It's $80 AUS to buy 14,500. So in theory if you wanted all of it its going to cost you over $350 bucks. \n\nThe game it self can be fun in parts but i cannot in good conscience recommend purchasing this game.",

When you pay for this game right now, you're buying the ability to beta test an eventually F2P game that originally had the promise that premium content would be granted as free access during this EA period of you paid in now. This is still stated on their website.\n\nRecently they've began implementing grossly overpriced microtransactions for digital currency for premium items, and after the fanbase gave their feedback on how badly received this is, Gameloft doubled down and now have began locking quests behind a paywall. As it is now, the developers are picking and choosing what feedback is heard, and they're pushing further to see what more they can get away with. \n\nWhat is here is pretty alright, I've had very little issue on PC versus the performance disaster that is the Switch port. Granted, I've sunk a ton of hours on Switch until the constant crashes brought me to playing this exclusively on PC. That being said, I never spent more on this game other than the initial purchase and I don't plan to in the future. If stripping future content and locking it behind a $20+ microtransaction is the developer's plan moving forward, look for a different game.",

Your menu is your best-friend!! It will show you where gems/fruits/vegetables/fish will be on your map so consult it as much as needed. There is no SET order for which thorns you should remove first you are free to open them in ANY order...BUT your quests will definitely guide you on which biome you need(I literally opened the biome I needed for a quest like 2nd to last so was not progressing through the story for the longest time lol)\n\nThis game IS EARLY ACCESS yes I have to yell it for the people in the back EARLY.

            "review": "Normally for veteran gamers on Steam, they would purchase a bunch of games and let some sink into the collected pile of dust (back log) due to they didn't realize how much less time they have for games, and some games simply gets the priority over another. \n\nThis is one of those games that normally sit in the dust until you are bored and wanted something different, and do note that there are way better casual games out there so the \"priority\" may be even lower than usual casual games we owned. \n\nEspecially for Early Access games, some veterans tends to \"come back later\" for a more stable version of the game. But for EA games, there's always a risk that some bad decisions making from the dev side might comes as a shock way before you even start playing. This one here is right about that. They start releasing pay wall locked contents before they even came out of EA... Well normally it's not a big deal for DLC, but they've decided to put a pricing worthy for a few indies games put together... that... is the major problem and why the majority of reviews suddenly turned red into the negative sea... Joining up to put my +1 vote to warn other players on what to expect of this game company and be aware of what installed for them if they buy this game.\n\nWhat you get here is a game filled with micro-transaction similar to those \"infamous\" Free to Play games out there. And as you can see from their recent DLC release, stories and quests contents are being locked behind more paywalls. And judging from what others said, this is more of a \"grind infested\" game than a \"casual game\" due to how you need to collect the in-game \"currency\" to buy more of those cosmetic and \"quest\"... Meaning most of the core mechanism of this game are behind another paywall, paying for this game alone doesn't get you the core mechanism, only part of it, you need to pay more (at a ridiculous pricing) for small chunks of these game play for as long as you wish to \"continue\" playing this game.",

            "review": "So, I have quite an extensive essay to say about this game. At the time of this review, it's still in Early Access and it's the June 7th update which introduced the Fairy Godmother and... Some other stuff I guess. \n\nNow I have played in my lifetime, every sort of high-end farming/crafting game of note. Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley etc, and I have a pretty solid idea on what I want in a modern game that advertises itself as something that fits along those sim categories. The closest resemblance this game has to any others, is probably Stardew Valley, but not in the ways you'd initially think.\n\nTo start off, if you are a huge (and I mean your wallpaper has hidden mickeys, huge) Disney fan, then this is a literal dream-come-true game. If you're here for a casual easy time, no end game, don't often play many games and wouldn't have an idea otherwise, then stop reading now, the game is utterly fine for you.\n\nIf however you're looking for something more in depth and you're looking for that next farming-sim fix or even a good pass-time game, then this might not yet scratch that itch.\n\nFundamentally, the game is still (even after multiple community surveys) missing some rather unforgivable QoL updates at this stage. I expected a lot more from Disney. They don't have the best repertoire of games, their studio for games has never been exactly anything special (I am discounting KH as that is just a SE game with a Disney IP). But, considering every piece of material and all the games of this nature that pre-date this by years, they're missing the mark entirely.\nSo at the time of writing, you can craft pre-made/design furniture. You can buy SOME basic essential blank furniture and throw a bit of pre-designed splash art on it to customise it. You can craft a type of path, a type of fence, and you can cook. You can craft enchantments, that you will never use as your tools are all one-hit-wonders anyway and it's a waste of resource. You can collect materials, and finally you can farm. \n \nYou cannot Batch Cook. You have to find and either manually add or \"Auto-add\" set ingredients. Cook. Wait for the animation. Hooray.- It's tedious. Almost every villager will have 2/3 cooking quests as well. (Food is also a source of increased running speed and the new air surf feature. It consumes it almost instantly, it's faster to just teleport.)\n\nYou can't store efficiently. It uses a chest based system where you will need at least 30 small chests, about 20 medium chests, or several large ones either in one chest room or scattered around your village. Most quests allow you to craft/use materials that are in your chests already when you get to a crafting station. Some quests require you to have the materials on hand in your inventory to deliver them or carry them to a crafting station (Even though you craft FROM your chests as a resource? It's stupid.) - If you have mismanaged your materials up until those points, I wish you all the luck in the world in either finding what chest in high tide you've put it in, or with re-gathering them.\n\nPlacement of items, furniture, paths etc is all blocked by the never-ending spawning of materials, usually ones you have x1000 of like Basil. In the placement mode you have access to your entire map, but if so much as a sprigg of ginger has spawned, you need to manually go over there and pick it up before trying again to place the item, which is also notorious because:\n\nYour menu resets to the top. - Scrolled down for ages trying to find something that wasn't in the category you thought it was? Wondered why the \"All\" tab on food makes it so nothing is alphabetised? You will eventually find it, then if you go to find it again, more often than not your menu has flicked back to the top of options and you need to essentially doom-scroll down again until you find what you were looking for. It just wastes time. There's no type search feature.\n\nFarming: You will only ever farm your basic veg needs until you have 50 of every item, then unless you intend to use it purely for display, you will only ever grow and farm pumpkins which are unlocked in the last zone. Pumpkins are the highest produce to sell and the best and easiest way to make money. I've been sat on 5mil for the better part of 6 months. Never farmed since unless a quest specifically told me to.\n\nScrooge's Shop: You might find one new item a week. You can't sell anything you have duplicates of. You will get a lot of basic furniture sold here too, stuff that comes with the base game like \"Red Couch.\" \"Basic Grey Counter.\" \"The same portrait of Micky you've seen 60 times.\" \n\nGoing back to talk about placement, let me be broadly frank, you are far more limited than you think.\nSo unlike Animal Crossing for example, which is entirely shape-able by the terrain tools in it's hills, water, etc. When I compare this game to Stardew, I mean that your farm/village has a fixed shape. You can't alter walls, biomes, rivers, ponds, or any sort of environmental placement. Because of this, I have often been trying to work around places and shapes that unnaturally fit, and pathways don't curve and can't be placed on slopes. I'm finding I have say, 20 squares made up exactly how I want them, nice furniture placement, maybe a hedge or fence. Then the surrounding area will look a total mess and frustrate me that I can't even finish a path (and then basil will spawn.)\nThis being said, you ARE given the entire map to work with despite having to have the villagers homes in somewhere. If I could give any new player advice, it would be to entirely strip your island, keep all the villagers in one place until you reach a point (I'd argue around the pridelands stage) where you can start comfortably having control of your map placement, and not get too excited to start building and customising your village until you're done with a SOLID margin of the game at this stage.\n\nThe economy:\nSo 134 hours in. I am STILL short on some resources, specifically gems which are a rare drop chance when you need very specific ones.\nThe economy on important resources outside of sticks, is ludicrous. Paths are completely written off, you will not have enough stone for a nice brick set of pathways because when the valley is divided up into squares, each square is pretty tiny and that's a single piece of path each. Animal crossing and Stardew are both forgiving in this. But this map is HUGE on a different scale. To make up for everything the villagers need, you're going to have to sacrifice your own wants and wishes for customisation.\n\nGathering is easy for basic necessities, but it's not the function, it's the time. You can get Kristoffs shop (Which will save you a good 2/3 hours of time) when he has things like Iron Bars in stock. But the drop rate on Iron Ore is low, you could be mining for hours and end up with 50 pieces or 5 pieces. You could argue that yes, this is the entire purpose of the game. Gather resources for 3 hours - do villager quest - rinse and repeat. But it's sadly unimaginative, tedious, and has even brought me to some points where I resent certain characters. Ursula and Airel will literally fly around the map.\nThe entire point of this game to me, feels like to waste time. You can interpret that as a good or bad thing.It's not designed to be completed, but to get to a space where I feel ready to feel like I can safely use my resources and breathe a little customisation into my valley, I instantly need all the resources again I've just spent. Crafts are COSTLY. Horde everything, use it efficiently and wisely or not at all for a time.\n\nThis game still uses in-game purchases and I won't even elaborate, stop normalising this. It's a bad practise. Don't buy from the store, it's like the Skyrim horse armour. Though the Event Path isnt too bad, you'll have the leftover stones already for that each time. It does however, only make me do basic activities when I have the rewards available for simply playing.",

I like how you can customize your valley and place pretty much anything wherever you want, even the villagers' homes :) My only personal gripe is that they have Mother Gothel in this game as a villager, and I could definitely see someone with mommy trauma not being able to complete her quests specifically or even speak with her, as she constantly gaslights and picks on you. Adding HER before even adding Rapunzel or Flynn is a very weird choice. Even a fellow villain like Maleficent would've been a more fun addition instead of Mother Gothel :(",

Is it for children or adults? If it's children, the moonstones shouldn't be sold in the game, perhaps put it somewhere else.

I finally got decent enough to have ONE efficient game, ONE, in which I LOST, and when it went to cash out the 1500vc(which is NOTHING), for some reason the server felt in needed to investigate and ended up crashing my game, and when I got back on, I was banned. I will never buy another 2k product, I will pirate the game, and I will use cheat engines and everything they don't want us to use that costs them money out of their greedy a** pockets. We get old gen games at new gen prices, they treat the honest players like trash, they can't do anything to combat the cheaters, and they care only about money, not their product. It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen.",

            "review": "NBA 2K23 is a yet another follow-up in the long-standing 2K basketball franchise that continues to release repeated versions of the same game, re-skinned and re-titled to fit the year, and the real-life players drafted that year, it represents. As expected the core gameplay has been worked on to perfection for years now so players know what will be brought to the table - just an overall smooth and crushingly-detailed basketball simulator. This isn't the first time Micheal Jordan has graced the cover of a 2K sports game, but a lot of time has passed since then and things have changed for the good and for the bad.\n\nIf you look to play this, you have to consider many things: do you care about the you-against-the-AI aspect of it all or do you really crave that online player-vs-player feel. If your heart lies somewhere in the middle, you have to choose a side here because there's no in-between. Playing online-only means that you will have two years at max before the servers are shut down intentionally, forcing you to pay top dollar for the inevitable next installment. Playing against the AI means 2K can't do s**t to you if you want to stay in 2K23, having fun at the various modes it has to offer - NBA 2K23 will be playable even after the specific game has been deleted from the store. So choose carefully... when it's on sale (don't feed the pigs even more).\n\nOn PC, this game is fun to play against the AI - no bugs, no glitches and an overall satisfied experience playing completely alone. Do I recommend NBA 2K23? Yes, if you play against the AI, If you aim to play online - please read the other reviews of players who've had an even greater experience than me there. It's a lot to unpack there, for sure.\n\nFollow your heart.",

But you'd enjoy one of the older games, especially the 2k14 one which is, imo, the best one on steam. \n\nAlso for no reason at all this game is 123GB large and it uses the last generation engine. Why is it so large, I have no idea when there are games that offer 6x the content as this and are only 50gbs. So yeah its not really worth buying, but if you want to have this year's game them go for it. You'll have fun",

MyCareer is basically very complex and broken. There are a lot of hacker and stupid issues in game. If you want to play MyPark, you shouldn't. You need to know 2K loves money (VC). I dont have any NBA game,so I bought it and I'm not regret. There are a lot of negative reviews, I'm just playing MyTeam and I will just play MyTeam so I didnt see anything that bad. I almost forgot,there is no 144hz in game. How ?. In 2023 %85 of the players has 144hz or 144+hz monitors.It's not that big deal but If I have this specs,I want to use it. CPU sometimes can do odd movements like Cedi Osman posterized my Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I read too many review people wrote about game crash and bugs.At auction house, just for once, my game just crashed. If you don't have any nba game and you just want to play MyTeam and versus to your friends,you can buy.\n\n\n[b] WARNING : IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MYPARK OR MYCAREER AND YOU ARE BUYING FOR THIS PURPOSE YOU SHOULD KNOW,THIS GAME HAS NO ANTI-CHEAT !  [/b] \n\n[b] WARNING 2 : IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY CONTROLLER DEVICE, DONT BUY THIS GAME. AT THE ENTERANCE GAME GIVING ADVICE ABOUT THIS MATTER.  [/b]",

I can't even describe it accurately -- it's a special blend of jank which feels impossible to wrangle. It's better to run solo than use them.\n\nEnemy AI would be really good, but every enemy has terminator accuracy, can track you through walls, and can eat anywhere from three to five .308 JHP battle rifle rounds fired center-of-mass from 15 feet (without body armor, btw). How tactical. Such realism.\n\nMeanwhile, you're an anemic slug with severe tremors and atrophied wrists.\n\nWhat a frustrating experience.

            "language": "english",
            "review": "At this point, I can no longer recommend this game with any good faith. My primary issues with the game are as follows:\n\n1. \"Early Access\" and the \"Supporter Edition\": One of the reasons stated for placing the game in early access was \"[i]to collect feedback and make larger changes to the game that couldn't happen if it was 'final'[/i]\". This would be fine, if VOID interactive didn't hard-lock some of the content they want tested behind a paywall. The normal, non-sale price for this game is $40 USD, which is already steep for a game in Early Access, that is not complete, and not in a shippable state. There is an additional \"Supporter\" tier that, while a frustrating addition, seeing that purchasing the normal Early Access edition is already made to support the game through development, is made even more egregious by being given multiple weeks access to updates before other players. This feels like a slap in the face to players who don't want to, or cannot shell out an extra $70 USD for the supporter edition. It's understandable that people who pay for the supporter edition receive some benefit, but temporarily hard locking content that YOU WANT TO IMPROVE AND WORK ON BUG FIXES FOR is not the way to successfully. Beyond early access to updates, the game's test branch is also hard locked behind the supporter edition paywall. This does not make sense. This feels like a greedy cash grab, and based on this alone, I would not recommend the game.\n\nUnfortunately, there's even more.\n\n2. The file size and lack of optimization: Ready or Not is 90 GB. The game used to run smoothly, and had a pretty good file size. After multiple updates, adding more content, I was prepared for the file size to climb, and was quite accepting of this. However, the climb from 40 GB in 2021 to 90 GB as of the most recent update is frankly insane. On top of this, with every update, multiplayer, and even single player, has become even more unstable. I can't play online with my friends anymore as at least one of them is disconnected or experiences a crash, freeze, or massive frame rate drops in every game we go into. I fully understand that this game is early access, and is subject to crashes, and things not working properly, but the rate at which this occurs is remarkably frustrating. \n\n3. The lack of updates: There have been just about two major updates in the entire history of the game. One major content update in June of 2022, and the Adam Update in December of 2022. There were some smaller content updates before the June one, but much of the time they were adding incomplete maps. There has been little communication regarding the progress of future updates, with VOID Interactive instead posting about the modding community, and how much work they have been doing. While I appreciate the modding community, and love how much modders add to the community, it feels like an absolute cop-out on VOID's part. It feels like VOID is using the skills of the modders, and the love they have for the game, to make up for the lack of updates on their part.\n\nWhile I could go further on things like the AI, lack of effective suppression, and lack of realism in some aspects (like the ABYSMALLY slow running speed), those are all things that are relatively acceptable in an early access game. Those are teething issues, and I feel like I've already touched on the big three aspects that bring the game down. In it's current state, I cannot recommend that anyone purchase the game.",

Subjects can sprint while you cannot, you can only tactically walk and the tactically walk slower.  Firearms do not accurately represent the real life versions. Firearm accessories are also not realistic you would mount a \"not Inforce WML\" on top of a P90 where your entire hand can not reach the activation button. The dev team spent time rendering a flaccid \"bird man penis\" for arguably the worst level rather than fix more glaring issues. Situations are not realistic. Terrorists from Yemen in the middle of committing a mass shooting are generally not considered \"barricaded suspects\". The dynamic animations cannot be stopped for any reason, it is painfully frustrating when you are ambushed and you can not cancel a shotgun reload (you will reload all 8 shells or die trying) or cancel a handcuff animation. The only alternative is to manually reload a single shell at a time which is equally frustrating.",

AI needs having another look at due to it's flaws. Enemy's spawn kill, they also know exactly where you are majority of the time. 1 last thing to do with the enemy AI is that some structures they seem to be able to shoot through and i can't. The audio has it's issues as well which doesn't help. Unfortunately there is no progression system and everything is just about the same when it comes to the different modes. I know for a fact people get put off when there is nothing to work towards.\n\nIf the game doesn't fix & improve on what needs to be done then i can't recommend this. This early access nonsense these days is just a joke. A lot of game can't fulfill there potential due how the industry operates today. such a shame. No wonder i always go back to the classics.",

In fact, if you've played Rainbow Six 3 or any of the earlier R6 games, this game will feel VERY familiar to you. Ready or Not basically feels like a 2020s remastered version of Rainbow Six 3. \n\nThat being said, the game feels like it lacks depth as a result. There is no mission planning or level maps, which IMO are sorely needed. Even though the shooting mechanics are very fun and the graphics are great, the game itself feels kind of tired, because it uses such an old school gameplay formula from basically 20 years ago.\n\nI'd say this game is okay. It isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either. The AI and all the bugs could still use some work, at least as of this writing. If you are looking for a game that is basically one of the old slow-paced tactical shooters from the mid 00's, but with modern day shooting mechanics and graphics, you would probably like this game.",

Because the game used to be good, and i felt like i was supporting that. But in all honestly i was contributing to a greater problem. This game has become nothing more than a cash grab. the quality of the content has gone down hill and they care very little for quality of life applications. Everything in the crown store, including the crowns themselves, is over priced. which makes it no surprise that the in-game currency has lost its value exponentially. Forced and unnecessary rarity of resources breed toxic behavior, and with pricing of items, including those needed for common crafting skyrocketing to astronomic proportions makes it as much or more of a grinding slog to acquire the money than it is to get the actual items. Also inventory space is locked behind a paywall, either with large amounts of in-game money or with actual money, and any attempt to dedicate to any crafting is impossible without the extra space locked behind the monthly pass subscription. Simply put, the game is designed to be unplayable without sinking endless funds into dwindling phoned in content.",

            "review": "The moment you've experienced a game where every single dialogue is voiced, other games might just start to pale in comparison. Yes, even that inconspicuous NPC in the most remote corner of the game world is professionally voice acted. Each corner of this game world unfolds a new story, an adventure lurking at every turn. Just pick a direction and start running; lend your ears to the happenings around you and before you know it, you're caught up in some dramatic quest, helping others or overcoming some danger. Suddenly, it's 2:00 AM, and you're contemplating if you should dive into one last dungeon before getting some shut-eye for work the next day.\n\nThere's something for every type of player. Love to jump into a quick PvP? The battleground's got your back. Want to wage wars and sieges over vast terrains? Cyrodil is the place to be. Prefer a medium-scale mix of PvE/PvP gameplay style? Try out Imperial City. If PvE dungeons are your thing, there's a whole range from easy to super tough, including normal, veteran, and trial dungeons. For explorers, hundreds of places across dozens of maps are waiting to be discovered, complete with numerous world bosses, delves, and public dungeons. If you fancy a solo single-player experience, you can have it your way. Tired of the classic Warrior, Rogue, Mage classes? Feel free to wield a sword and shield while conjuring spells. Your proficiency grows with whatever weapon you choose to master. Played Skyrim and miss it for nostalgia's sake? You'll find Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and more. Whether you want to be a thief or a killer, it's all up to you.\n\nAre there downsides? Sure, the company may appear a bit greedy with its loot boxes and the need to purchase new chapters with real money. However, all the other DLCs in the game can be indirectly purchased with gold. Once you've got the hang of the game, earning gold becomes child's play.\n\nMoreover, the versatility of gameplay this title offers is truly astounding. Crafting enthusiasts can lose themselves in extensive crafting systems, designing weapons, armor, or even brewing potions. For the lore lovers, there are countless books, scrolls, and notes scattered throughout the game world, revealing rich backstories and hidden secrets. Social butterflies will appreciate the in-depth interaction systems, allowing forming alliances, trading, or just enjoying a chit-chat around the in-game taverns.\n\nIn a nutshell, this game doesn't just offer an RPG, it presents a living, breathing world that's waiting for you to leave your mark.",

Yes I enjoy the Elder Scrolls in all flavours.\nThe accessibility updates have improved playability somewhat, I was putting up with a lot.\nSo when using Steam, no more typing passwords. The controller support in accessibility mode works well and we have text to speech, but only in chats.\nWhat would make this better for the visually impaired?\nI have two items on my wishlist if any Devs are listening:\nEzpand text to speech to all text in game, this would be a massive help in the inventory and other menues.\nThe more difficult one, but I still feel it's possible, is to have a Scout. Here's the plan, in it's basic form it would call out to help you pin point the direction you should be heading. This will get you to the map marker you are targetting, a boon. They can also tie into the perks you get guiding you to any plants, ore veins etc that you find whilst on your travels. Spotting range based on level of perk.\nThere would still be the odd quest that would be problematic, but the above would make things so much better when soloing.\nUntil then if you see someone walking into walls in town or trees in the wilds, it may be me. Say hi.\nOh and if there is anyone who fancies helping someone who is Visually Impaired out in game drop me a message. I would love to set up a guild with people willing to help and gather others who are also visually impaired under the guilds wing..... I can dream.\nOh and did I mention, I really like the game.",

            "review": "If you're looking for an MMO with clear love and care put into every inch of it, then look no further. With goals, consistent pacing, incredible voice acting as well as smooth and varied combat, in the 400 hours I've put into this game I've hardly scratched the surface. However incredible this game is, it's never without flaw.\n\nFor one, the base game - whilst still incredibly vast and intricate, can be somewhat limiting without ESO+. Some dungeons and rooms will bear striking resemblance from Grahtwood to Reaper's March, but it's not enough of an issue to be overbearing. \n\nSome aspects of the game encourage routine or obsession - i.e daily login rewards.\n\nBasic recipes and unlockables do not transfer between characters, though styles do.\n\nWithout guidance, some classes can be a bit of a drag.\n\nThere are items that boost stats by a small amount for a limited time that you can purchase for real money, but frankly almost everything you yourself can make will always be better.\n\nI've found coming into this game to have expectations - I jumped in blind and still had an amazing time - but know that this game -is- at it's prime when you are subbed to ESO+. Trust me when I say that it, at the very least, gives you a bang for your buck. For as long as you're subbed, you get every bit of DLC and crowns to spend on fun cosmetics in the store. \n\nThe DLCs and lands beyond are where this game hits it's stride. Elsweyr, Summerset Isles, Morrowind, Skyrim, High Isles, all of it. The stories are so vast, incredible, and grasping without teetering off of cool aesthetics and gameplay vibes. \n\nSPOILER:\nI was walking through the desert jungle in Northern Elsweyr. I heard a Khajiit calling out to me, the voice actor clearly being Liam O'Brien. Of course, I paused in my journey to hear what the cat-fursona of Illidan Stormrage needed, and he was panicked and frustrated about his temple's acolytes being utterly entranced and insane by something. Travelling to this gorgeous view, we're met with some little Alfiq named 'Skooma Cat'. He makes some little remarks, cackling and giggling before leading us to the temple, to where the priestess is perched on the ledge, gigging and crying out about how throwing herself off would let her see what their lunar gods had in store as for salvation. Turns out, Sheogorath had taken control of the temple for fun, and we have to play his game to get them unstuck.\n\nThis was an optional, very easily avoided side quest. There are hundreds of these everywhere, with plots thick and writing sublime.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It can be played easily as a casual player or sweaty if you're feeling hardcore.",

            "review": "I don't believe this game would even be alive today if it weren't for the fact that \"Elder Scrolls\" is in the title. The combat doesn't feel good, it's very floaty and lacks impact. The majority of quests are boring, the game is absurdly easy to the point that you could set up a program to just play it for you and spam you through the 90% of the game with zero interaction from the player. It's basically a game that could have an auto-play function dropped right into it as far as difficulty goes. (High tier end game/PVP being the only exception, which doesn't erase the fact that a vast majority of the game is mind numbing easy)\n\nOn top of this, the game is absurdly expensive and has zero respect for your time and money. The cash shop is filled with optional purchases that sells fixes for problems the developers created, or to just outright skip the grind. There's also gambling in the form of loot boxes with drop rates IRL Casinos wish they could get away with. There's a monthly sub on top of being required to purchase the latest expansion each release. Without the monthly sub the game will effectively attempt to annoy you and cheapen your experience just to entice you to purchase a sub.\n\nThe grind to get anything particularly worthwhile will probably take you months, in the most extreme cases you'll be grinding for a year for a single mount.\n\nThe only thing ESO has going for it is that it's set in the Elder Scrolls universe, and that's the only reason the game didn't die years ago as an over monetized, boring cash grab like the dumpster fire it is. If this game had been released by a studio that no one had every heard of and not Bethesda, no one would be praising it.",

Then we graduated and still play the game as well, most of us have 2000-3000 hours of play time.\nA few days ago, 8 of my friends' accounts were suddenly banned, which is ridiculous. A group of people who logged into the game and used oak soul ring and held the left button and didn't let go to finish the daily game, then looked at the appearance of dressing up, building houses, and going to relax would be banned?\nWe rarely play eso in the last 1 month, some people have not logged into eso in a month, I don't know what the reason is, customer service work orders reply for different reasons for everyone, there is a guy whose entire property is not more than 2m who received a banning email for selling gold, Lmao, and someone else showed the email title is eso content is fo76 banning notice from the eso team.\nIt's crazy, and there are bad bot support replies where they just change a few of the sentences and keep sending them to you, forcing you to accept the result.\n\nI suspect it's because they all use the ip provided by the internet acceleration provider, and there are other people in the same ip that violated the regulations.\nNot all places are that good, no network acceleration service to connect na server will have 300+ ping\nAFAIK, this has been happening every June for the past few years, and false bans due to network acceleration services are common in other games as well.\n\nOne of them was lucky enough to meet human support and unblocked.\nBut the others are still in the same bad situation, emails from support will only repeat the last words or not reply to the email at all\nThey are still waiting for the result of the process, which is a painfully long process, and this emotion spreads to me.\n\nI don't know if eso's anti-cheat system is as reliable and efficient as eac and battleye's. The people in charge of anti-cheat bans are so lazy that they could always, continuously check if the players are normal and violate the rules, they could check the players' data, they could track and eventually ban the real violators and protect the normal players.\nHowever they choose to block a large number of people with suspicions in a concentrated period of time, one of the multiple users from the same ip has a problem, then it is quite possible that other users also have problems, and then slowly rank them? I don't know what they will do.\nMaking a mass error ban in a long-running, role-playing game that requires a lot of time and effort to be put into it would only shatter the player's illusion of the game, realizing that his dedication is meaningless and that everything precious to him could suddenly fade away\nWhy don't we make an announcement in advance that playing eso between April and June and logging into the game has a lottery with a chance of getting banned\n\nWouldn't think that players who have gone through this kind of thing would come back to play the game after their accounts are eventually unblocked, right?\nThere are so many good games out there, who will continue to play your sh*t game?\n\nPut these normal players into the June banning of a large number of illegal players news bulletin\nGood job zos",

            "review": "I haven't been very far through the game as for what I could see after 59 long hours was : \n- too much boring quests\n- I don't really like the fact that everybody is the main character and, even though I really like the dragon break theory, it's a hard to swallow pill\n- constant inconcistencies\n- first quest log entry for the main quest spoiling the conclusion of that said quest and that is a major bad point I think as it shows some huge negligeance\n- horrifying low difficulty when questing\n- repetitive combat system that really drives you to alienation\n- towns filled up with other players \"pets\"\n- esthetically over the top mounts\n- immersion breaking silly cosmetic rewards worn by so many other players\n\nI found it really hard to play, and as I said, not because of difficulty, but because it is painful, to the eyes as well as to the mind. I know that it's supposed to become more interessant when you reach a high enough level to do high difficulty group dungeons or pvp, but seriously, if you have to go through all of that, as far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the effort. \n\nThe other issues in the game are shared with many other games because it's a structural issue in the game industry : \n- you have to pay for everything. You have bought Elseyr chapter but you want to visit both areas of Elseyr ? Well, you have to buy the DLC for that other half of said region\n- excessive fan service conflicting with clumsy attempts to expand the audience\n\nFinally, let's speak about the good aspects of the game because there are some : \n- high enough level of character personalization\n- nice setting (main quest plot, era, general context)\n- very nice natural sceneries\n- well designed towns\n- some fun NPC's\n- some quests are not boring and let you discover some aspects of the lore\n- I don't like crafting but those who do may find it quite diversed and rewarding\n- nice ideas underlying the class combat system (but is it well executed ? I think not)\n- fun bestiary\n\nIn conclusion, I would qualify the game as being a gauche chimera forcefully bending and twisting the Elder Scrolls universe to fit in a not so well designed mmorpg.",

            "review": "I love this game a lot, it is one of my favorite MMO's of all time. If you are a casual player and don't care for PvP/Endgame PvE, this is a great MMORPG for you, especially if you like the Elder Scrolls universe. Although the ESO Plus membership is not required to experience the full game, if you plan on playing ESO as your main MMO you are definitely going to want to get it as it allows for you to carry unlimited crafting materials, and unlock all the DLCs for the game for however long you have ESO plus, and much more. \n\nThe Pros: The solo story is awesome and engaging. The world is huge and consists of almost every part of Tamriel (Yes, you can visit Skyrim). Dungeons are so fun and the raids are even better. There are also solo/group arenas that can prove to be quite challenging. The different bosses and mechanics that come with them can be very challenging and rewarding, getting you different gear sets, armor/weapon motifs, titles, etc. Classes are pretty standard MMO classes. You have your tanks, DPS, and healer classes. You can also choose your race but it doesn't mean to much unless you are trying to maximize stats. The leveling system, gear system, and character customization is perfect in my opinion. It is simplistic yet diverse and allows for multiple different builds and looks for your character. Mounts in the game look awesome but could definitely be better. From what I have experienced, the community of this game is amazing. I have met nothing but generous and wholesome people on this game, whether it be from trading, dungeon running, raids, guilds etc (PvP community is horrible). Expansions and DLCs are unique and are honestly required to experience the full beauty of ESO. They add lots of new zones to explore, gear to achieve and storylines/bosses to complete. The graphics are also better than any MMO on the market that is actually fun to play, however that doesn't matter much to me when looking at games but it is a plus. Performance is also pretty decent, I have never crashed or had any crazy frame drops but I do have a super PC so take that with a grain of salt. The game also allows addons which can be very useful depending on what you use. The PvP in this game is some of the most fun I have had in an MMO by far. \n\nThe Cons: ZeniMax Online Studios are one of the biggest clowns in the gaming industry. The development team behind this game, primarily the leads who make the big decisions have no business being at the positions they are in. All they care about is money. This game is so predatory to new players in terms of how the in-game shop works, not to mention the loot crates. For example, almost all of the mounts within this game have to be bought using either real money, using gems which you earn from salvaging items from loot crates, or currency from daily/weekly missions which can take months, maybe even years to achieve for ONE mount. There are only a few mounts which can be earned through actually playing the game, which are extremely difficult to attain even as an endgame player and don't even look that appealing. The monetization is just blatantly obvious that they do not care about player satisfaction. Not to mention that they have also banned users on their forums who raise concern about said issues. The servers are absolutely terrible. They attempted to fix them but somehow made it worse. This results in PvP/PvE being a laggy mess. Not being able to cast a skill or use a potion in certain scenarios is the difference between life and death. They could easily fix the server with the amount of money they make, but they don't care. Not to mention the hundreds of bugs that have still not been fixed for years, some even game breaking, but don't worry they added a new house that costs $200 USD. The toxic and unprofessional nature of the development team of ZOS is why I am giving this a bad review. They do not care about the players, they only care about the casuals money. I could go on and on but I don't think steam will allow me to write that much.\n\nConclusion: The core game has the potential to be one of the best MMORPGs on the market, but the lack of a professional and passionate development team is why this games player base has dropped tremendously over the years. If you don't care about endgame content, you will love ESO and by all means, you should play it because you will enjoy it if you are an Elder Scrolls fan. However, if you are a hardcore gamer and want to go for the crazy endgame PvE titles, gear, achievements, and climb the PvP ladder, avoid at all costs because the developers could care less about you and just want your wallet.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrLS3ROGw_A",

The game is unreliable at best. Every update breaks something and fixes take too long to implement. After half the endgame community quit last year it's even more frustrating to play because new players have to learn how to play from veteran players, the game doesn't teach anyone how the multiplayer mechanics work like roles. So much unpaid labour by the players, whether in guilds or otherwise, and if we ask the devs questions on the forums like \"do you have an update on this bug fix?\" they may or may not respond. When I quit it was because blocking damage was bugged for months, and at the moment Crown crate gifting has been broken for months. Guilds use these as prizes and incentives, to raise funds for bidding on ridiculously expensive guild traders. After this much dev hostility towards the player base for this long, I'm out. I probably won't be back and that sucks because this was my favourite game and I met some really good people playing it. I'd bet a lot of money the Necrom release is going to be the worst game-breaking update yet. Spend your money elsewhere, somewhere it's put back into maintaining the game.",

Sadly, I guess my account got deleted when Kakao finally dipped. \n\nPA looks to be changing things around slowly but surely. Can't find too much p2w aside from needing a tent and horse flute. Maybe fairies if you wan't to play that rng game. But, silver doesn't weigh anything anymore, they give you like 3 pets right off the bat, they give you the ability to have global storage, and even a skill that adds weight. Not to mention seems like they enjoy giving stuff away during events and seasons.\n\nEven if you wanted to buy stuff there are a ton of new player deals that give you a ton of extras for like $5. There are a few recent YT vids explaining how it's less p2w better than I can. Go watch and learn up if you are skeptical. I know i was lol.\n\nDoesn't feel scummy anymore. Just PA trying to improve whats already a great mmo.",

However, it takes a lot of time to really get results and there are a lot of in game purchases that help things go along. I played this game in November 2020 with over 850 hours at the time. I spent upwards of $500 dollars and had numerous characters, billions of dollars, a large collection of items, armor, gear, etc. I'd devoted heavily to the game despite not having much money IRL. I recently returned to this game and found I'd lost all of my account stuff as they had changed companies and deleted everything. I reported this to the customer service requesting some compensation for the loss as I'd been in the process of moving at the time of the transfer and was unaware of losing my account. The customer service basically informed me they wouldn't do anything to help and it was tough luck. I was extremely upset as they could have done something to assist me in restarting. Aside from this incident, the game itself is very fun with constant updates and an active GM staff. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in fast paced combination combat and in-depth life skills. I'd also like to note there is a sequel coming out soon.",

            "review": "I cannot believe I am playing and enjoying an MMORPG in 2023. After years of being totally repelled by anything remotely resembling the genre, I've logged almost 80 hours here and have been having a fantastic time.\n\nThe two things that set Black Desert apart from the rest of the (imo) generic trash out there are:\n\n- (Actual) realtime action combat (this is not FFXIV!), which feels responsive, flexible, and impactful (unlike every other MMO), and...\n\n- Lifeskills, which are what really keep me playing. You can buy property, hire workers, chop down some trees, build a boat, sail the MASSIVE ocean, catch rare fish (or go diving!), fry them up (in a bunch of different ways!), and sell them on the market. All of these steps are supported by numerous, creatively interwoven systems that you are free to engage with, selectively exploit, or ignore entirely, depending on what you want to do.\n\nIf you've ever played an MMO and thought \"what if the fishing minigame was a fishing MEGAgame?\", this is where you belong.\n\nI think I've spent more time gathering, cooking, farming, and messing around with economic systems than I have fighting things, and to be clear, I LOVE fighting things in this game (Maehwa and Corsair main, here). I just can't wait to sail more, upgrade my ship, and really get out there. There is so much to see and do!\n\nAnd what a pleasure it is to SEE - the game is gorgeous. It is a joy to travel around and see the world, with all the different locations, enemies, armor and weapon designs, pets... Of special note is the ocean, with its sparkling waters and ebbing waves. Good stuff.\n\nThere are, of course, some negatives.\n\n- Speaking of travelling the world, there is no fast travel. This will be a negative for some. Personally, I love the immersion that comes from this, and it gives me an excuse to engage with the horse taming/breeding and sailing systems (god, I love sailing), as well as the storage/transportation systems.\n\n- This is the elephant in the room: there is a cash shop, and while it's not P2W, there are certain things that you'd wish the game just... gave you (being able to call your horse from anywhere is one of them), rather than charging you for them. It's not a dealbreaker for me, especially considering there is no subscription fee, and the base price is low.\n\n- Armor/weapon enhancement is done through a roulette system - some people will hate this, but it hasn't impacted me negatively (yet) as there are clever ways around it. I also don't mind a gamble. YMMV.\n\n- Dyes, on the other hand, suffer from an objectively terrible roulette system with no real alternative - buy the palette pack, engage with a pointless roulette and hope you get the right color/style, or... get used to default colors, I guess. This BADLY needs a rework.\n\n- Sadly, you (currently) cannot dye ships, though you can dye wagons and mounts, along with pretty much everything else. I really, really hope the devs do more with ships in the future.\n\n- Let me repair my Epheria Cog, or release an alternative. C'mon. I don't want a big, hulking vessel; let me enjoy my lil speedboat.\n\nTo summarize, if you're sick of garbage combat, unfulfilling lifeskills and economic systems, and P2W nonsense, Black Desert might be your jam.",

When you buy things, it's easy to understand even for the less tech savvy people. \n\nThe game has so many places to get answers to your questions regarding quests and things that are game related that makes it more enjoyable as well. \n\nThe general chat is less desirable some hours but gets better as you play. If you don't want to read it you just pop another chat up and you don't see it. \n\nCustomizing your character is out of this world in depth. I was astonished and amazed at how many things you have control over as far as your characters looks. If you don't know what you want, there is something for that too. There's a whole database of previously done character looks to choose from for each type. \n\nThere is a ton of content for every level and play style. If you want to craft you can. If you want to fight things you can. If you want to tame horses you can. If you like farming stuff there's that too. There's something for everyone and every mood. You can also get and decorate your houses. You can have a house in every city. It's neat. \n\nIt was well thought out.

It respects your time and being an action rpg is actually enjoyable to do combat in to. \n\nI am at the 1k hour mark and i returned a month ago, This game constantly has me learning and doing new things, Life skilling is fun for once in a mmo and i can actually play it solo without needing to be carried 24/7 for progress. Everything in BDO IS progress to something. Its very rewarding and very, very fun. \n\nThis game has been simmering and been developed for a long long time, for 10$ its a steal.",

The \"top\" negative review saying its \"pay to win trash\" is a complete clown comment and that person has no idea what they're even talking about lmfao.\n\nSure you can spend money to get things super fast, but you can just legit get everything without spending money. Unless of course you want one of those premium costumes (sometimes you can get them in events) or artisans. You can also craft some costumes too which is better than nothing honestly. Imperial cooking is really profitable I find when you hit Guru boxes.\nThe game is fun to just run around and do quests and kill mobs in my opinion, and if you do spend in pearl shop it helps to pay attention to deals and if they come with coupons to save tons of pearls on purchase.",

            "review": "Eat my nuts Ubisoft, you are so grossly disconnected from your community. It is a true shame to watch a game that you enjoyed and loved be slowly butchered by a company that only exists to slowly drain the wallets of their fan base. I sternly believe that Ubisoft purposefully brings out stupid updates and changes to slowly kill the community so that they can let the game die and move on to other projects, while also doing crossover events to steal the money of their dedicated player base. I think ubisoft is just ashamed to come outright and say that they don't want to support or update the game anymore, and just wish to slowly kill the game along with its community.\n\nUbisoft, long ago, ever since they switched dev teams, have lost sight of what siege was supposed to be. Siege is unique, the original path of the game was to have it be a sort of in-between your average arcade shooter and your slow tactical shooters like Ready or Not. However, over the last several years, I feel as though this concept has been lost on Ubisoft, they even try to vilify the part of the community which disagrees by creating the character Deimos. This brings me to the story, why the hell is there one. The lore of the game was that Rainbow Six was a multi-national counter terrorist agency designed to eliminate the most dangerous of terrorist threats. Great, stellar, that is all we needed. Nighthaven was a decent concept, but it was executed so poorly. I think it would have been great to add a PMC group to the team, seems great, but then you give them ungodly advanced levels of technology, rivaling and even surpassing entire nations, that then for some reason creeps into the lore of certain gadgets. It was so unnecessary to do this, I just don't understand why it was done at all. An actual story was and is being developed, and I can't understand why, they bring in a character named Deimos who they say is the villain, yet his only flaw is his moral compass. He is objectively right about rainbow six as a whole, it being a joke and no longer the intimidating counter terrorist organization it once was. Early on in their development of the story, they transition the leader of Rainbow from some lady to some British guy named Harry. This was the start of the fall for siege, as it signified the start of this random ass story building that they wanted to do. \n\nNow a bad story may not necessarily mean the gameplay is bad... except it fucking blows ass. Ubisoft, in the same way they ruin the story, they bring out certain changes to slowly ruin the game. Sledge is a prime example, he was a good operator, in no way broken, he wasn't even very highly picked, yet they took away his smg 11 and made him a 1 armor, and then to add insult to injury they took away his acog later on. What was the point of this, he was never broken or over picked, he was pretty well balanced, and now he is just a worse pick than buck or ash. While not all balance changes are as bad as this, the vast majority of changes that Ubisoft decides to bring out are just bad for balancing. They also have a tendency to nerf things rather than to buff them, or if they do buff operators, they don't make an impactful change. This leads to all ops becoming worse and therefore not as fun, rather than uplifting other ops and making those more fun. The last set of changes have been things such as the UI or kill indicator. They had no reason to change any of these, especially the ubisoft overlay which barely even works and somehow still buggy despite being years after release. The kill indicator is no longer quite as satisfying and snappy as it once was, which makes kills feel less rewarding and not as fun. Continuing, the UI is just a mess. It is confusing, especially for new players, and was so unnecessary. It also plays more into the concept of this game becoming more arcady and \"cartoony\". Lastly, and likely one of the worst changes so far, is the ranked 2.0 system. For some reason, people fail to understand how it works, so the rundown is basically that there are two mmrs that a player has, a hidden and visible, the hidden is what actually pits players against each other, the the visible just exists as its own thing? Like who verified that this was a working system, why in gods name did they try to be innovative on a system that was tried and tested? The hidden mmr system just doesn't seem to work, pitting what would be ranked 1.0 plats against ranked 1.0 champs. Leading to imbalanced, irritating, or boring games, along with poor balancing. The visible mmr also serves no purpose, as it is criminally easy to hit higher ranks, leading to a more than 1000% increase in the amount of Champions. Why does it exist, why are players not given a ranked based off who they play with, why is it based off how well they play against their specific skill level? It leaves no incentives to improve and only the incentive to play and hit champ. The fact that a person with a 12% win loss can hit champ is disgusting. The best of the best of players are the ones meant to be hitting the highest rank in the game, yet for some unholy reason, they just invite morons into the group. If I remember correctly, take this with a pinch of salt, I believe their justification for this was to \"reward players not just based off skill but also how much they play\". They essentially removed the ranked part of the definition of ranked. If I played chess for 16 hours a day for the rest of my life, but remain among the worst players of the game, why in gods name should I be given the title Grandmaster when I would not be able to compete against any other legit Grandmaster? It makes no sense to reward people for play time, and grant them something that they do not deserve. The incentive to play in ranked 1.0 was to improve so that you could hit the higher rank. Without the need to improve, it leaves the community overall worse. Maybe the devs brought it out so they could finally hit a rank past gold.\n\nNo words, not even an entire essay, could describe my dissatisfaction with Ubisoft and how they have handled this game. They have failed the community, the gameplay, and somehow, the core concept of the game itself. It would take an utter buffoon to see what is happening and think to themselves, \"this is perfectly fine\". Take a lesson from any competitive shooter and stop focusing on your casual community. I think the view point of focusing on it to just be completely wrong. While it may bring temporary life into the game, most casual players don't really care about the game and can leave on a whim. Focusing on the ranked community, particularly those at the top bracket to ensure the longevity of a game as those are the people who tend to be the most passionate about the game. Further, the devs of this game either don't really play the game or suck ass at it, so they aren't even good at understanding balance changes. For a lot of games, the devs are actually pretty good at the game, this is because they built the game so they understand it. I would think the devs for Siege, now being the one's making it, would also understand it. Of course not that would be smart and reasonable.\n\nI will sadly, and much to my own chagrin, keep playing the game. This is because there is no other game around like it, and frankly,  this is the only reason the game is still around. Everyone shits on EA for their crappy economy decisions in their games, yet for a lot of the games, they improve and fix this issue, and even in the case of the sports clones, it is easy to just avoid their copys. Just look at battlefront 2, it is a stellar game now but it did release to some controversy. Yet Ubisoft, rather than trying to improve their game, reward the worse parts of the community, and sacrificing everyone who actually cares about the game. They are as arrogant and foolish as Narcissus, since both Ubisoft and he fell in love with themselves.",

            "review": "i have to say, i'm deeply disappointed with the direction rainbow six siege has taken, especially since the release of ela. the game used to rely on strategy, communication, and careful planning. but with ela, the delicate balance that made siege stand out among other shooters has been disturbed, turning it into something more like a standard run-and-gun title.\n\nbut my biggest gripe, the real knife to the heart, is the mishandling of the character \"havoc.\" havoc was teased in the game's e3 trailer, portrayed as this intriguing, menacing character who was supposed to bring an exciting twist to the game. the trailer did an excellent job of building hype around havoc - the character's design, menacing aura, and what appeared to be a unique gameplay mechanic.\n\nthe trailer painted a vivid picture of havoc as a new villain, a ruthless operator, who seemed to be bringing a new level of intensity and danger to siege. it suggested that his arrival would significantly shake up the game's dynamics, posing new challenges and creating fresh strategies for players to explore.\n\nhowever, this was all a pipe dream. despite all the hype, despite all the anticipation built up, havoc is nowhere to be found in the actual game. it's a classic case of false advertising and has left many fans, including me, feeling betrayed. we were promised something exciting, something groundbreaking, but what we got was a no-show.\n\nand if the mishandling of havoc wasn't enough, the writing has also gone down the drain, exemplified by the addition of \"dokkaebi.\" her bio intro is just cringeworthy: \"her fingers dance across the keyboard, the light of the lcd screen underscoring her smirk.\" it's a cheesy line that feels out of place and makes her character feel shallow and uninspired. it's not the level of writing one would expect from a game with the pedigree of rainbow six siege.\n\nit's hard not to feel misled and deceived. the absence of havoc in the game is like a promising movie trailer with no actual film to follow. it's like being served a mouthwatering menu with no food to eat. it's not just about one character - it's about broken promises and shattered expectations.\n\nthe game has deviated from its roots, focusing on quick action and flashy gimmicks rather than on deep, tactical gameplay. the introduction of ela, the misleading portrayal of havoc, and the cringe-worthy writing for dokkaebi have made siege lose its identity, and it's a real shame.\n\nin conclusion, if you loved rainbow six siege for its strategic depth, teamwork, and engaging characters, you might want to give it a miss for now. unless the developers make a U-turn and steer the game back to its roots, it's hard to see this title reclaiming its former glory. so until then, i can't recommend this game.",

            "review": "Yes, I'm giving it a thumbs down after over 3500 hours played. Want to know why?\n\nBecause a game that basically lives or dies on its workshop content should not hit you in a face with a literal spreadsheet every few weeks so you can spend an hour making it work again, and in the process also figure out which of your favorite mods it made obsolete by breaking the backwards compatibility again.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nTo me, over a third of the game's value comes from the workshop - half of it is just extra content, but the other half is quality of life fixes and utilities, many of which are critical to me to properly enjoy the game. And they know it as well - they integrated ideas from mods into the game, they hired modders to be their employees, the mod spotlight is basically using mods as their marketing material. For a project that so desperately relies on the unpaid work of their loving community, they sure have a nasty habit of exploiting that love.\n\nA long time age they started aggresively squeezing the cash out of us with tons of small, simple, and expensive DLCs. Then, a while back, they started using bigger DLCs to regularily break the compatibility of workshop content, effectively discouraging long-term modding projects. And since the remaining modders didn't want to maintain multiple versions of their mods depending on which DLCs you have installed, they just started assuming you have them all, and made their mods require them. Which means that the game effectively started holding the mods hostage until you buy the DLC, indirectly monetizing free content.\n\nAnd then, they announced the sequel.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm excited for the sequel. I hope they will improve the engine so it can get bigger, better, and will allow for even more creative mods. Let them do all the things that this game could not. Honestly, they can release just the engine and the mod support and it would still be a big hit.\n\nBut with a sequel on its way, what's the point of buying this game at this stage? So it can turn into Sims and make you buy all the DLCs a second time for the CS2? So you can get your hopes up and let them disappoint you if it won't work out?\n\nDon't buy this game. Just wait for the sequel. And in case it turns out to be a money-grabbing, buggy, rushed, exploitative trainwreck, aiming for nothing more than finding new ways to abuse and monetize the relations with its community, then you can come back here and try this one instead, because it's definitely worth it.",

As is, I can't even download maps because they require the DLC. If you could pay $5 or even $10 to get the DLC for a month, it would have certainly increased the reach of the game. Instead, you get this exploitative garbage. Sad, because otherwise, it's a great game.",

My recommendation against purchasing is due to frustration with the pricing. Even on sale the DLC is extortionate in price. This game is approaching a decade old, which is fine for a game of this type, but at this point the all-in price should be close to $60 when it *is not* on sale. It's not magic; this is the most exactly-what-you-expect game there is. I love the experience they are going for, and I've had it in other games for a fraction of their ridiculous prices. I checked this on *yet another* sale after dozens of tries, still the same DLC gouge. I'm done trying. I'll probably never get back into this game. There must be a parallel universe where this game went for half these prices, and it's the true continuation of the old old modded simcity vibe, with a vibrant community surrounding it a decade later. Can we go there? Can we Mendala effect our world to that timeline so I don't have to be so disappointed?",
