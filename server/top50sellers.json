            "review": "[h1]Spoiler free review, with a short and a longer version (including the online):[/h1]\n\nShorter version\n\nBuy this game if:\n\n✅ You're in love with and you want to dive into a heavily story driven Western game (which feels like a tv-series sometimes)\n✅ Open world exploration,shooting, side questing, item collection and completing ( sometimes long) challenges is something you’re interested in:\n✅ In case you want to enjoy online features at its fullest: you’re willing to spend 10€ or you local currency into it to avoid unfun early game grinding;\n\nDon't buy the game if:\n\n❌ (IMPORTANT) your PC’s spec aren’t meeting even remotely the average suggested requirements, as having proper graphics, light and game effects improve drastically the in-game experience and activities such as: shooting, resource gathering and hunting;\n❌ when playing open world games, you often engage only with the main mission stories and skip/leave aside the optional game content; \n❌ you’re looking for a straight online matchmaking or for a refined experience, as that mode was sadly abandoned and not further developed years ago. You’ll find more about online in the detailed section of this review down below;\n❌ (IMPORTANT) you don’t want to have a Rockstar account which is active and online while you’re playing as it’s mandatory;\n\nVerdict: 9 \n\nTime required to finish the single player game campaign: 30 hours \nTime required to complete it at 100%: 200/250 hours (took me 250 including online achievements)\n\nLonger version:\n\n[b]a) realistic and historical american environment [/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972922065\n\nRDR2 takes place by the end of the 19th century, in an imaginary area that could be generally summarized as a mix of Louisiana, New Mexico and Nebraska (or any other US state filled with a mountain type of environment).This excellent mix of different biomes is filled with hundreds of animals of all species; fauna itself is “real” in the sense that their behaviour and daily (and nocturnal) life are well represented and very close to reality (i.e. you’ll see owls flying into the night mostly, different temperatures etc…). You’ll really feel like living in a beautiful yet hazardous country, enhancing even more the immersion and the narration.\n\nAnother great touch of realistic fauna: when hunting animals, different weapons and ammunition, along with the animals’ body parts that will be hurt will lead to different results when hunting, for example shooting a rabbit with a shotgun will destroy the carcass, while using a bow with a precise shot or headshotting it with a low calibre rifle will allow you to skin the animal properly and get a higher quality pelt and more edible meat quantity.\n\nFunny side note: horses will p00p. A lot. Often. Consider yourself warned.\n\n\n[b] b) Clothes, voice acting and face cameras:[/b]\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972367589\nGiven how accurate and detailed the clothing (of all kinds, even the pijamas!) is (and not only that) the immersion is made much deeper, thanks also for the countless hours spent by the developers’ team and the actors/actresses while animating the characters while in game and during the cinematic cutscenes;\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972965029\n\n[b]c)\tNarration and gameplay: (dis)honorable choices and (grey) remarkable characters:[/b]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2972612738\n\nRDR2 has a “honor bar” system, which goes up when helping people, being honest or being merciful and goes down while being the opposite, impacting both how NPC perceive you, in part how the game will end and how your companions and surroundings will interact with you; all the characters…are quite remarkable and deep, the whole roster of people have all their own story and background, even those who don’t see much screentime or play an important role in the story…it’s almost impossible to not be or become somewhat fond of them or even not remotely interested in their stories and epilogues.\n\nThe narration is extremely fluent and hits hard thanks also to its main protagonist - Arthur Morgan – which is one of the best fictional video games characters I’ve ever seen in my experience due to his versatility, his falsely crass (yet extremely fun at times) attitude, his sarcastic comebacks and his overall growth, in every aspect.\n\n\n[b]d) Red Dead Online, few important points to mention :[/b]\n\nThis game mode is set up in the same world that you’ve spent your single player campaign, sadly whether you’re going to play to get the online achievements only or to just enjoy it for the sake of it, my advice is to buy some online currency and unlock two specific roles (collector and bounty hunter) to be over with the online as quickly as possible. To be more clear and specific:\n\n1- there are microtransactions, worsened by the fact that the cost of each item on online mode is multiplied excessively in comparison to its single player counterpart;\n2- is it possible to farm online currency with daily and weekly activities but in a really slow pace, which really doesn't go well with the nature of RDR2 online which allows for free roaming, but becomes chaotic pretty quickly;\n3- there are many griefers and cheaters on online servers, which can slow your progress, even though changing servers usually gets your rid of those annoying people;\n4- the online gamemode could have seen some more love, sadly GTA online was/is too profitable to be put away in favor of this one, probably harder to be managed/modded and rectrated due to its historical setting;\n5- as soon as you'll join online mode you'll be swarmed and overwhelmed by ingame messages,tutorials, tips and quests, making the learning curve quite brutal. I'd recommend playing 5-10 hours of single player campaign before going online;\n6- most of the fun online is made by roles, which are \"licenses\" which will unlock you key rewards, new activities and game modes. Sadly those are behing a paywall, literally. \n7- some online items (example: clothes, horses and equipment items) aren't into single player mode, which is a shame, but this happens when the online experience isn't as well thought of as the single player one;\n\n\nThanks for reading and for bearing up with me, leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations, have an amazing day/night, feel free to follow my other reviews at: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32344423/",

This game is an absolute masterpiece and one of the best games I have ever played. The attention to detail in this game is incredible.

[b][i] Do note that I don't usually write a review or make an essay out of it but this game deserve one!. [/i][/b] The game itself is very immersive probably one of the best I've experienced. The landscapes are awe-inspiring, from the rugged mountains to the rolling plains, each with its own distinct atmosphere and beauty. The attention to detail is staggering, with dynamic weather and realistic animal behavior breathing life into the surroundings. It's a world that basically begs players to explore.\n\n[b] Development [/b]\nThe greatest thing R2D2 have to offer is the deeply engrossing character development of Arthur Morgan. As a member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur is a complex protagonist with a troubled past and a conflicted moral compass. Through the course of the game, players witness his transformation from a loyal outlaw blindly following his leader to a man questioning his actions and searching for redemption. The writing and voice acting are exceptional, capturing the nuances of Arthur's personality and emotional growth.\n\n[b] World Immersion[/b]\nThe open world is filled with diverse missions, side quests, and activities that complement the overarching story. Whether engaging in intense shootouts (as always~), doing heists, or simply exploring the wilderness, the gameplay remains consistently captivating. I have over 70+ hours now and I haven't even complete my first playthrough (due to exploring the map, side-activities and irl education/work). With all that, there are still things which I have yet too discover! Like who is Gavin??!\n\n[b] TRY IT! [/b]\nWhether you're drawn to the allure of the Wild West or simply appreciate a masterfully story driven game, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an absolute must-play. While writing this down I should also note that Arthur Morgan is hands down the best protagonist out there!<3\n\n왜 아직도 읽고 있니? 이미 구입!\n그리고 모두 즐겁게~~",

            "review": "[h3]Now THIS is how to tell a story.[/h3]\nRed Dead Redemption 2 features the most gripping narrative I’ve ever seen in a video game. The epic journey of Dutch Van der Linde's gang of outlaws is full of so many jaw-dropping, cinematic, action-packed moments, but still stays believable as the protagonist Arthur Morgan slowly frees himself of his life-long gunslinger ideals. And every character in the Van der Linde gang’s saga feels remarkably human, thanks to fantastic writing and voice acting that perfectly complement this game’s stunning visuals, detailed animation and beautiful music.\n\nAll of these elements combine to make the world of Red Dead 2 come alive in a way that no other open world game does. The massive five-state map is incredibly dynamic, with missions, side quests and random events of equally high quality perfectly interwoven into an enchanting world that constantly changes with the flow of the main story. And there are so many little details throughout this game - from memorable NPCs to colorful customization options to fleshed-out minigames - that make the experience feel authentic.\n\nEven though I absolutely loved the phenomenal story and atmospheric world of Red Dead 2, the gameplay mechanics can seem shallow when taken out of context. Granted, there’s nothing wrong with the core controls - the shootouts are fun even on controller thanks to the Deadeye time-slowdown ability, and riding around on a horse is simple but satisfying. However, responsive controls are sometimes de-emphasized in favor of handholding gameplay and \"realism\" in regard to difficulty and mission structure. Horses automatically steer themselves on rough terrain, animations make looting and crafting take longer, many missions include trailing sections so the player can get where they need to go… et cetera.\n\nUsually, when a game prioritizes realism over immediate gameplay like this, there’s a weak link somewhere that breaks my immersion - such as bad voice acting, weak writing, faults in sound design or visuals, or spacing of content around the map. And this usually results in these “realistic” game mechanics becoming more tedious than they are immersive, distancing me from whatever atmosphere is trying to be established. But.. this isn’t the case with Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\n[h3]Red Dead 2 might be the first game to [i]fully convince[/i] me of its own world's authenticity.[/h3]\nThe immaculately detailed world and unbelievably human characters of RDR2 breathe life into in-game tasks that I would normally consider boring, like trailing missions, herding animals and catching fish - making even these less inspired gameplay segments pretty damn fun. The gameplay mechanics aren’t untouchable on their own, but the sixty-hour-long story pretty much is, and it’s paired with an intricate portrayal of 1899 America that makes the narrative just as enthralling as some of the greatest movies and TV shows ever made. This commitment to realism and thorough storytelling makes even the slower paced segments of the game exciting, and the intense parts (like shootouts) more meaningful.\n\nI’m already partway through my second playthrough now, and I’m having even more fun this time around trying to dissect the incredible character dynamics and details of the open world now that I’ve beaten the game already. The more I play Red Dead 2, the more fascinated I am with the spectacular story and cast of characters - and the few issues I originally had with the mechanics have become less and less noticeable in the grand scheme of RDR2’s monumental scope. Rockstar has created a true masterpiece here, and the gripping tale of outlaw Arthur Morgan is a story I’ll never forget. 10/10",

Enemies and traps are scattered all throughout the map and can create different experiences each playthrough.\n\nI've played around three matches and had a blast with randoms, and with friends. The game optimization is great too, and I haven't experienced any technical issues or stutters.\n\nLooking forward to playing much more of this game.",

            "review": "I very nearly stayed up all night playing The Outlast Trials on my first outing with it yesterday, so that alone is worth a recommendation, but a lot of reviews so far aren’t really getting to what’s in this game, so I’ll take you on the tour of what I’m referring to as “Outlast-lite”.\n\nThe Outlast Trials (TOT) is a cooperative survival horror game. You and (optionally) up to three other players (friends, randoms or a mix) are thrown into spooky trials under the auspices of test subjects undergoing “therapy” at the hands of the Murkoff Corporation. You're given gruesome tasks to complete and you do these while avoiding or managing enemies that wander the maps. To aid you through this, you’ll find items sprinkled throughout the levels, and, additionally, you can select a loadout of perks and permanent upgrades that give you special abilities and boosts that you upgrade between missions, giving players the motivation to keep replaying maps.\n\nAnd replay maps you will. TOT has three primary big narrative story maps that’re absolutely super. You’re never overloaded with story, but the primary antagonist of each scenario is clearly presented, and the horror of what’s being asked of you is always deliciously entertaining. Furthermore, there’re six shorter missions that take place in a different map within a similar tileset to the primary ones. These don’t have as much story but do give the same gameplay taste and I thought they worked well as additional content that didn’t require as much development time. Finally, TOT offers a higher difficulty option for all the levels (though you unlock many of these later on), which adds difficulty modifiers (more damaging enemies, more traps, fewer items, etc.) that I think a lot of the levels really need once you get a bit of experience with the game.\n\nTOT is very much “Outlast-lite”. It has all the gruesome themes of the previous Outlast games, but what made the originals scary is precisely because you’re all alone in them. In TOT, there’s always another player near enough to bail you out of the messes you get yourself into. Even if you get downed you just go “oh well” and wait for someone to pick you up. Enemies never really scare you per se because you get fairly adequate warning that one’s seen you (even if you can’t exactly figure out where they are) and you can simply leg it for a room or two and then hide in a cupboard until they get bored and leave you alone. There’s the odd jump scare when a monster hiding in a locker throws itself out at you, or a gas pipe goes off next to you, but they’re very mild compared to the jump scares in the original games. Small caveat is that the tutorial is exclusively played solo and is arguably the scariest level in the game because of it, but if you can push through that then the rest is very manageable.\n\nHowever, TOT being Outlast-lite is possibly the exact twist that you, the nervous and anxious reader that prefers not to play horror games, needed to enjoy the series. You can simply cling together with your friends as you shuffle around the levels, constantly chattering for comfort as you go. That said, TOT is good at forcing players to split up, and the obtuse map design can make it difficult to meet back up again, particularly when you factor in the enemies roaming around, but I maintain that TOT’s scare factor is generally much milder than its predecessors.\n\nTOT’s most challenging element is navigating your way around. Each run at a level randomises some map elements including available pathways, breakable/trapped doors, objective locations and enemy spawns, so you’re always orienting yourself around the specific layout you get each time. Map design itself is deliberately obtuse as several objectives require you to search the area to find objects you need to progress, and it’s stunningly easy to get lost. No doubt experienced players will learn the maps in time, but starting out you’ll get lost a lot, and I think that’s all part of the fun. The voice chat works perfectly so you can ask others for help when you get stuck, or use the radial communication menu for a similar effect.\n\nMap layout aside, you'll find the general challenge of the game will drop off sharply once you get experience. There're some mission modifiers that make things challenging, but most missions are very, very easy with a group of experienced players. Red Barrels critically need to look at ways to push the difficulty considerably because I've been in several groups that can clear the side missions in under five minutes and still get good individual player grades for it. It's actually more fun to have a mix of ability levels in your group because it slows the game down and allows you to enjoy it more. You only really get in trouble if you mistakenly end up in a dead end, or run into another enemy or series of traps while trying to escape an enemy. The harder difficulties punish mistakes more by making enemies do more damage, or by restricting your resources, but even those aren't meaningfully challenging with a few hours under your belt. The current matchmaking system groups you with players of a similar level of experience, so once you hit the level cap then levels will be trivialised by the combined experience of the group.\n\nOn the topic of matchmaking, it’s a bit of a mess. You’d think you’d pick a level and get matched with others looking for that level, but that’s not the case at all. It simply matches you with other players (admittedly very quickly) and then you either have to talk about what level you want to do, or you just accept whatever level the group leader (decided randomly) picks. This system is fine if you don’t mind playing any random level, but it can get a bit frustrating if you’re trying to do something specific.\n\nI’m not super qualified to talk about the solo experience (I’ve done 3 maps solo), but I can tell you that there’s a degree of scaling on the objectives (i.e. you do fewer), and you get several lives to retry a map with if you die. It works fine, but the game does feel like it was intended to be played multiplayer. You should be able to test this within the steam refund period if you want to try it out (should be enough time for the tutorial and one level at least).\n\nPerformance-wise, PC gamers have “enjoyed” a slew of unoptimised messes lately, but Red Barrels has pulled through with a beautifully optimised experience. It’s not bug free by any means, and some interactions get a bit quirky in moments, but my playthroughs have been really smooth. Very impressive stuff for releases at the moment. Furthermore, TOT is listed as Early Access, but there's a decent amount of gameplay here if you don't mind redoing the levels on the harder difficulties, and the whole package is so well put together I honestly feel they could've full released TOT as is and it'd have been acceptable.\n\nOverall, I was very sceptical that a design like TOT would work, but developer Red Barrels have absolutely smashed it out the park. Arguably a better experience with friends, but I've played a majority of my games with randoms and I've had a lot of fun. What’s available at the moment is really impressive and I hope that they release more trials and challenges to build on this excellent foundation. If you’ve been nervous about playing a game in the Outlast universe then this is easily the most accessible because you can get others involved to help you.\n\nFinal note: the arm wrestling minigame in the lobby area is surprisingly entertaining.",

            "review": "The Outlast Trials goes beyond the norms of an immersive horror game, offering a blend of spine-chilling thrills and a deep sense of camaraderie. With its seamless gameplay, brilliantly designed challenges, and escalating tension, it stands out as a testament to the dedication of its creators. But what truly elevates this game is its ability to forge genuine connections amongst players.\n\nA shining example of this was my encounter with a fellow gamer whose selfless actions created a memorable gaming experience. Despite remaining silent throughout, their commitment to our survival was loud and clear. Always stepping up to revive my buddy Justin and me, our teammate turned out to be a beacon of teamwork amidst chaos. When it was late in the night and we finally had to call it, their kind words promised more adventures, rounding off an exceptional session. The Outlast Trials is not just a game, it's a testament to the power of gaming to create meaningful bonds, even in the midst of horror. Highly recommended for the thrills and the friendships you'll forge along the way.",

            "review": "[h1]The Outlast Trials Review[/h1]\nDon't feel like reading the whole thing? \nDown at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game! :)\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nDid you know that Mr. Daddy is a puppet of a goose that fixes your cavities? Now you do, so schedule your appointment for a bright smile! The Outlast Trials is a multiplayer game developed by Red Barrels, bringing Outlast's intense fear and tension into the multiplayer genre of horror games. Will they succeed in creating a terrifying attraction, or will it be just another of the bunch? Let's find out.\n\n[h1]The Goose is on the Loose![/h1]\nThe game hooks you immediately, thanks to the adrenaline one feels while playing it. Running, closing a door, and hiding during a chase is exhilarating! In the trials provided by the Center of Rehabilitation Murkoff, teamwork and attention to detail play a crucial role in surviving the experiments. You can notice doors are wired with traps if you inspect them with your eyes or that puzzles such as the valve one follow a set of tubes pointing to the correct valves to activate.\n\nIn addition, there are goggles used to see in the dark. These are vital for exploring obscure areas full of hazards and enemies. It adds a new layer into consideration due to their limited use as they run out of batteries, and searching for recharge can be stressful and mind-boggling when lights go out in the middle of a match. The prioritization of the team and the items to be utilized test the team's mettle in facing the trial individually and as a group!\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981045667\n\nThe formula has been shaken quite a bit, as unlike previous titles, this entry introduces rigs and prescriptions to the table. Think of these as your class and perks, respectively; they dictate the focus of your playstyle. For example, the green rig allows players to heal teammates and themselves, making it an excellent choice for teamwork and more defensive styles. Meanwhile, the red rig allows one to stun enemies, more suited to those feeling more daring and looking to evade or confront the residents during chases. \n\n[h1] Looks like we have... a crime in progress.[/h1]\nOn the other hand, the enemies are less practical than they are a show to behold in amazement. Psychopaths exhibit these personality traits that make them seem silly and funny but don't detract from how menacing and bloodlust they are. They will relentlessly chase you as they seek to end your existence, and the IA is smart enough to detect your general location based on your actions (a step on glass, making noise, or moving too fast).\n\nThe levels are limited; with only two bosses and a few maps, there is little content yet. The game relies on repetition to get good scores and unlockables to keep you engaged. It is in Early Access, and you can tell, as there are bugs such as the game not registering inputs or foes getting stuck and not moving. However, these were rare. There is a need for more content to make the title feel more diverse and keep the tension going, as once you learn the maps, it's more of a game of how fast you can clear them. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981045478\n\nThe game is undoubtedly good; playing with people and solving puzzles as you evade the local abominations is fun. I wish the game would tell you more about the controls; however, some actions, such as sliding being a perk or running while looking behind you, need to be stated precisely. The layout could have also been more intuitive, as some input combinations can be forgotten mid-chase.\n\n[h1] Art Design and Visuals [/h1]\nVisually it looks great; it is Outlast, after all. The presentation is there, and the maps are interesting; on the first try is a fight for survival, while subsequent ones are challenging to get that good evaluation score. The fear aspect is there, but it evaporates the more you play, which is a shame for a title with such attention to detail.\n\nThe graphics are good-looking, and the models are well done; some aspects are mixed from the story into the visuals. Evaluations give a performance to the player that tells them everything they did right and wrong as constructive feedback, allowing them to improve at the game. Most such improvements depend on the visual factor, seeing things on the screen and learning from the environment. Search for items, see which hallways are safer, or plan an escape route. Seeing a window and thinking, \"Won't that make enough noise to attract foes?\" changes the approach to gameplay through visual cues, which is fantastic!\n\n[h1]Sound, Replayability and Performance[/h1]\nThe voice acting is funny, particularly Mrs. Gooseberry. It is so enjoyable listening to her chit-chat with the puppet she carries. The quality is fantastic, and it has moments, as Mr. Daddy can tell you to run when Gooseberry is near or the locals beating you up while complaining about the most random things. It finds a way to get a chuckle out of you every time.\n\nThe game's sound effects are diverse; it counts a massive selection of sounds and visuals to increase the player's immersion. Screams are piercing and loud while being under the effect of psychosis changes how the world is perceived as sounds, and the screen becomes distorted. These touches add more richness to the Outlast Trials experience. \n\nOn replayability, the game is enormous. Each map has multiple challenges to accomplish, but even more important, it has an EXAM version of the trial. These add insane modifiers to make your odds of surviving low, and it changes the dynamic of gameplay so much it feels like a new game at times. From doors that open and close mechanically to fewer spots to hide in or other surprises, I let you discover them as they add a lot to a game with few maps, which is appreciated.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2981045230\n\n My specs are RTX 2060, 36 GB of ram, Intel Core i7-11700K - Core i7 11th Gen Rocket Lake 8-Core 3.6 GHz LGA 1200. on High settings, the FPS was between 61 to 75 at all times. On Medium, there is an increase from 84 to 96.\n\n\n[TABLE]\n[TR]\n[TH][H3]Pros[/H3][/TH]\n[TH][H3]Cons[/H3][/TH]\n[/TR]\n[TR]\n[TD]\n[list]\n[*]Outlast makes the jump to multiplayer with tremendous results!\n[*] A multiplayer horror game with an intense fear factor!\n[*] progression is rich and keeps you engaged. Each upgrade is meaningful.\n[*] Addictive gameplay thanks to high-tension chases and the scoring system!\n[/list]\n[/TD]\n[TD]\n[list]\n[*] The variety of maps leaves something to be desired.\n[*] Not balanced for single-player mode despite having the option.\n[*] Due to its Early Access, it feels lacking compared to previous entries. (this con is temporal)\n[/list]\n[/TD]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1] Conclusion[/h1]\nOutlast the Trials is an immersive and addicting game that makes you want to keep playing it as you progress through its levels and progression. Red Barrels shows the competition that there is a way to make multiplayer horror remain scary while adding enough choices to warrant exploration in its challenges and gameplay. If you are a horror fan, this game is a must-have to add to your collection.\n\n9/10  AMAZING\n\nIf you enjoy and find the review helpful, please follow my curator StarsDeck! https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43679955/",

            "review": "[h1] \"Look upon my works, foul creatures, and weep at its magnificence.” [/h1]\n\nSystem Shock represents a first-person shooter (FPS) game with emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving, originally developed by the company LookingGlass Technologies and published by the company Origin Systems in 1994. \nThis remake (2023) has been developed by Nightdive Studios and published by Prime Matter. Further notable remakes / remasters of the development studio are System Shock: Enhanced Edition (2015), Blood: Fresh Supply (2019), and Blade Runner: Enhanced Edition (2022).\n\n[i] Pros & cons: [/i]\n\n++ The station feels and looks like a real place. Every corridor offers aspects to explore, audio logs to listen to, and occasionally secrets to find. Some of the items can even be manipulated to your advantage, just try to drop a monitor on an enemy, or switch off the lights to gain the upper hand in a stealthy maneuver. All these factors ensure that the player is constantly entertained and at the same time looks over his shoulder; a wonderfully immersive combination.\n\n++ I just love the fact that this game demands attention from the player; such a refreshing challenge. No quest marker, no journal, just you and a piece of paper.\n\n+ The little mechanic about vaporizing junk items, to recycle them and gain cash, hits my hoarder mentality / advanced gamer OCD right on target. By now, I have abandoned my main quest and dedicated my humble being to the holy crusade to collect every junk item on the station. The sacred recycler demands its sacrifices!\n\no I already rue my choice of level 3 puzzles. They. Hurt. My. Brain. Dear reader, if you are interested in a less painful encounter with panels that will test your mental capacities (to the utmost degree), I strongly advice you select level 1 puzzles at the beginning of the game. You have been warned, hacker.\n\n- There are some dark sections in the original, and by that I mean pitch-black corridors, which add to the uneasiness. This title has the ‘better’ lighting, which I view a missed opportunity to enhance the horror factor of the overall experience. \n\n[i] Summary: [/i]\n\nHow I missed it to wander around in confusion on a maze-like space station overrun by androids and mutants, while an artificial intelligence conjures up my untimely demise and delights in my clumsy progress. I consider this an excellent remake and a masterclass in atmospheric immersion.\n\nRecommended for connoisseurs of faithful adaptations, and gamers with a hoarding disorder.",

There are many improvements over the original but there are also some tideous aspects of it that carried over, but to be fair, without those it wouldn't be Shock as we know it. Some creative liberties were taken with the remake some for better, some for worse but in general it balances out pretty well. The gameplay loop is spot on. It really feels like a Shock game.\n\n[h1]Details[/h1]\nThere's a new scrapping system. You can vaporize junk (anything that's not weapons, ammo, consumable items or key story items) and turn them into little scrap cubes that you feed to a recycler to get money. Smells like Prey to me but a cheap Wallmart knockoff of it, but that's fine. It can help you out if you need a few extra bullets. They also added a cargo lift so you can transport items from deck to deck. Think of it like the storage box in the Resident Evil games. When it comes to inventory managment, its the good ol grid. If you can fit it, you can have it. You can also find inventory expansions which is a great design decision honestly. Exploration also seems to be as equally rewarding as in the original. As much as the game is dumbed down compared to the original it makes it up by bringing a lot of new stuff in.\n\n[h1]My gripes with it[/h1]\nBoth classic games had a banger soundtrack both ambient and techno rave. It's honestly written in their DNA due to how iconic some of these were such as MedSci and Hydroponics of SS2 and Executive and Reactor of SS1. It's a shame to see that they decided to not include some of these bangers in the game. The ambient music is often drawn out by eeire noises which kinda sucks. The Reactor deck in this reboot honestly has a great remix of the original Reactor keeping both the song's identity while appealing to the new more atmopshe oriented vision of the game.\nOne last thing, the guns. Well not the guns themselves but how they interact wit enemies. The enemies upon dying just ragdoll in a silly manner like it's GMod.\n\n[h1]Is it worth the price?[/h1]\nI'd say wait for a sale. It's a pretty good game that knows the target audience well but 40 euros seems like a bit of an overkill.\n\n[h1]A list of bugs and issues for Nightdive to fix[/h1]\n- Gibs are really unoptimized and drop the otherwise fine framerate severely.\n- Pressing backspace in the log transcript doesn't bring you out of a log menu.\n- The combat music plays even when it really shouldn't.\n- The front hand is not gripping the shotgun properly",

I found myself opening secret doors on muscle memory and smiling.\n\nFor new comers there's a solid game here, if you like bioshock, shock 2 or Prey this is a game worth exploring and there's a demo so you don't have to take my word for it. The puzzles are not hand holding though so be careful to pay attention to those messages if you want to make progress through floors but if that isn't your thing you can actually turn the plot difficulty down!

Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy. I am drunk with this vision. God: the title suits me well.\n\nThe System Shock Redux Remake is a fantastic development for fans of the original 1994 game. The remade version of the classic game has greatly improved graphics, along with enhanced mechanics and a modernized UI. The new graphics look stunning and make the once pixelated world feel alive. The controls are fluid and responsive, while the AI has also been improved to create a more immersive experience. The UI is cleaner and easier to use than the original game, and the sound design is equally impressive. The atmosphere in the game is intense and atmospheric, with a haunting soundtrack that perfectly complements it. This remake is an excellent homage to the classic game, and with new content and features, it's an absolute must-play for fans of the original.",

            "review": "The real shocker is that, after all these years, the game is finally out! \nIt's in such a good state, even hackerman approves!\n\nSystem Shock remake isn't for everyone. It's a relic from the past, from the good old days of gaming, where games were made to entertain the players. Back then games were usually hard on default and did not have the handholding modern games do. No regenerating HP, waypoint indicator and in a lot of cases no autosave/checkpoint system. You had to figure out everything yourself (or get a guide lulz).\n\nNow if you have some nice memories from the good times or are a fan of the original System Shock series, this game is made for you. You'll love it, guaranteed. On the other hand, if you are part of the new generation, this can be your entry to the reliquary. It's a game with modern graphics, with some quality of life changes, but old game rules. A really carefully made remake of a titan of its time. Check out the demo first, you  have nothing to lose.\n\nAs I've already mentioned, the game is really faithful to the original game. It clearly shows the devs love towards it. Even the new additions to the remake are very carefully crafted and feels like they've been part of the 1994 classic from the start. Not to mention it's well optimised. A phenomenal job indeed.\n\nSure there are some caveats, like not much ambient background music (Why tho?) and some minor bugs. Like I have to disconnect my gamepad when playing this game because it's always pressing the right button on the menus and it's fking annoying. Some key rebinding issues etc. I'm sure these will get fixed pretty soon. Also DLSS is in the game, but no FSR (again, why tho?) or HDR (the demo had HDR even if it was broken and the game would look fantastic with it, fix it my dudes instead of dropping it from the game).\n\nMan, I wish you guys were the ones making duke nukem forever. I'm sure it would have turned out differently.",

Modern games have taught us that the developers will make sure that we do not get lost in their game and constantly present everything on a silver platter. This game won't hold your hand. It's up to you to navigate and fight through it. It may not appeal to everyone, but giving it a try is a must, as it is a very influential game and the granddaddy of its entire genre (Thief, Deus Ex, Bioshock, Dishonored, Prey 2017) \n\nI forgot when was the last time I felt in the game that I was not led by the hand, but really given food for thought and space for experiments.\n\nFor those who are going to try this remake, I will only say one thing: give the game a chance, let it rock a little, because the first 2 hours of gameplay can be very confusing. I would call it a period of adaptation to a non-standard gaming experience, which not every modern game can let you experience.\n\nOverall, I am highly satisfied with what Nightdive accomplished and I can recommend the Remake.",

            "review": "This game sat in my Steam Wishlist for about 6 years. There were times when I thought it was never going to be released. Now that I have played it a little I have to say that it was well worth the wait. I played the original System Shock back in the 90s and it remains one of the best games I have ever played. That game was well ahead of its time with lots of little things that gamers take for granted now. For example, it was the first game I ever remember playing with a \"lean around corners\" feature. Now, all these years later, it's very clear to me that this remake was a labor of love for the developers. I am really enjoying the game. The visuals are good, but retain the feel of the original game. The soundtrack is really good; very cyberpunky, techno, and creepy. I am so glad that the devs, while upgrading the visual and audio technology, decided to leave overall gameplay mechanics of the original game in tact. The game does no hand-holding. You are in a huge, yet claustrophobic, enviromment, with a HUD map and compass, but there are no \"quest markers\" to show you where to go or what to do next. You simply have emails and audio recordings from the dead crew of the space station you are on to give you info and clues in an in-world narrative way--passwords, objectives, locations of ammo and supplies, etc. I admit that some modern day gamers with little patience may have trouble sticking out out with this game, but from my perspective, it adds to the immersion of the experience. I am enjoying the circuit breaker puzzles for opening doors and taking down shields, and the couple of times I have \"jacked\" into cyberspace have been pretty enjoyable. I like how the visually protrayed cyberspace in the game, again with modern tech, but the old school aesthetics. I'm only a fraction of the way through the game, but I am guessing this will end up being my favorite game of 2023. If you've played any of the Bioshock games and enjoyed them, but never played the original System Shock, you owe it to yourself to play this progenitor of those games.",

Thank you, Nightdive, you did perfect job and I hope for a System Shock 2 remake someday.",

I think this is exactly that.\n\nThe idea of some rando coming into my single player game and forcing me to change my preferred slow and methodical gameplay style seemed like a terrible idea. The cool thing about the invasion mechanic is you can set it to friends only, or turn it off entirely. That's what I did for my first playthrough of the campaign. I had a blast. The invasion mechanic is actually really cool if you want to play through the game again. I'm in the process of getting all the achievements and medals currently. It's fun to have others turn up in my game and give me some fun PvP interactions. It's also to load into someone else's game and try and slowly hunt them down. The 4 person survival modes are a ton of fun. They really bring out the fun in using some of the secondaries provided. My campaign playthrough was mostly rifle for distance, pistol for close quarters. Survival was the SMG's and shotguns time to shine. I don't really have an opinion on multiplayer matches, I've not really played much of any of the game modes. I'm currently playing through the campaign again with a friend in co-op and it's a lot of fun. Something I really appreciate is the ability to switch to first person view on all guns. That's my preferred way to play.\n\nNot much of a groundbreaking review to be fair. I liked the previous games, I liked this one with invasions turned off. I liked playing again with invasions turned on. I liked doing the invasions myself. I recommend it.",

If you can start the game at all (lots of reports that people can't), and if you play without crashing (lots of people complaining about crashes), and if you can put up with bugs that are being \"looked into\" for months, and if you can run the game long enough for memory leaks not to send you crashing, then you can play.\n\nSurvival mode is a disappointment, lacks the luster SE4 had for replayability, and has coding issues where sometimes poor spawns or out-of-bounds vehicles end your game.  Also too few maps.\n\nThe maps are beautiful in most cases, but there is repetition (designer laziness) in some of them and you are not as free as you'd like to be.\n\nWind effects do not compare with SE4 unfortunately, and also there is no authentic plus mode, both of which make the game less challenging than most would welcome.\n\nWeapon modifications are too complex and silly, too overdone.  And some weapons that should appear do not.\n\nThe game is geared towards console warriors, and the game is cross-platform.  PC Steam users do not get the attention of the developers in the forums.  The most you will get is some lame acknowledgement (sometimes, not the majority of time either) that they read the issue, then you get told to contact support, who does nothing in most cases.\n\nUpdates are still 40 GB and up, all the time.  \"We are working on it\"\n\nMost maps are not sniper-generous.\n\nI enjoyed the single player campaign, but replayability is not as good as SE4.  If you play multiplayer, be prepared for a host of cheaters and disappointments there, IMO mostly because of all the console action that is now in the game.",

Lots of attention to details.\n- Sniper rifles have a new distance based aiming mechanic. Still it's a far cry from what Sniper Contracts offers.\n\nCons:\n- Plastic faces. I've never seen so bad faces in a AAA title. Crysis from 2007 looked better.\n- Horrible terrible stupid AI. I'm playing on authentic and it's just not there. AI won't see you when you're right in front of it. AI will however spot you when you're crouching 50 meters away.\n- Not a lot of new stuff if any in comparison to previous installments.\n- IRL something that's guarded is guarded at all times. Without ifs. That means it's ridiculous that you can sneak in almost everywhere without being spotted.\n- I can pick up a fourth gun which is the same as mine but with better modifications or the one which is not yet available, why? I can use it. If I switch to my own primary three guns, this fourth gun is dropped. What the hell? Found modifications are not unlocked by picking better guns.\n- Enemies popping out of thin air. This happens e.g. when you destroy objects and you have enemies \"sleeping\".\n- Not enough traversal freedom. Too many areas of the game are blocked seemingly for no reasons.\n\nBuy only when it's on sale.",

I also feel like the story wasn't as good as sniper elite 4 it's still worth it for the gameplay in my opinion. They added a few new features which surprised me but in a good way for instance they removed the golden skins and replaced them with camo varients which are unlockable by finding a workbench or achieving a specific amount of kills. One of the things i like alot about this franchise are the unique maps they out did themselfs definitly an improvement from their latest release the vr version which i assume has smaller maps because of the vr technology not being great yet. \nConclusion you shouldn't buy it for the story/graphics but for the gameplay.",

Nice selection of guns, although a few from earlier in the series locked behind DLC, but from what I see we're not missing much if you haven't bought them. If you're new, don't worry, you won't be lost story wise or gameplay wise. Play this for cathartic Nazi sniping action with some badass slo-mo cameras.\n\n",

I finally got decent enough to have ONE efficient game, ONE, in which I LOST, and when it went to cash out the 1500vc(which is NOTHING), for some reason the server felt in needed to investigate and ended up crashing my game, and when I got back on, I was banned. I will never buy another 2k product, I will pirate the game, and I will use cheat engines and everything they don't want us to use that costs them money out of their greedy a** pockets. We get old gen games at new gen prices, they treat the honest players like trash, they can't do anything to combat the cheaters, and they care only about money, not their product. It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen.",

Without directly naming anyone, I expressed my frustration regarding cheaters in a discussion forum and my message was swiftly deleted. The moderator expressed that even though I did not call anyone by name, I am not allowed to insult cheating behaviour in general. I was also asked to add citations to my message which I think it not necessary in a gaming forum. Not only do players themselves have to report cheaters one by one with extensive video footage, we are also not allowed to name call the very cheaters who (for years) have been disrupting our days/game-play everyday. I have also invested a considerable amount of time and money in the My Team game mode and cheaters are able to quit the game when they are losing and the score will not count. This is unacceptable and not professional behaviour by both the cheaters and the management. This seriously needs to be investigated.\n\n(If any cheater reading this is having an existential crisis and is deeply offended by my review, I simply don't give a damn. I will be in Ante Up if you want to vs me but you don't have to bring your balls because we all know you don't have any.)",

As expected the core gameplay has been worked on to perfection for years now so players know what will be brought to the table - just an overall smooth and crushingly-detailed basketball simulator. This isn't the first time Micheal Jordan has graced the cover of a 2K sports game, but a lot of time has passed since then and things have changed for the good and for the bad.\n\nIf you look to play this, you have to consider many things: do you care about the you-against-the-AI aspect of it all or do you really crave that online player-vs-player feel. If your heart lies somewhere in the middle, you have to choose a side here because there's no in-between. Playing online-only means that you will have two years at max before the servers are shut down intentionally, forcing you to pay top dollar for the inevitable next installment. Playing against the AI means 2K can't do s**t to you if you want to stay in 2K23, having fun at the various modes it has to offer - NBA 2K23 will be playable even after the specific game has been deleted from the store. So choose carefully... when it's on sale (don't feed the pigs even more).\n\nOn PC, this game is fun to play against the AI - no bugs, no glitches and an overall satisfied experience playing completely alone. Do I recommend NBA 2K23? Yes, if you play against the AI, If you aim to play online - please read the other reviews of players who've had an even greater experience than me there. It's a lot to unpack there, for sure.\n\nFollow your heart.",

But you'd enjoy one of the older games, especially the 2k14 one which is, imo, the best one on steam. \n\nAlso for no reason at all this game is 123GB large and it uses the last generation engine.

MyCareer is basically very complex and broken. There are a lot of hacker and stupid issues in game. If you want to play MyPark, you shouldn't. You need to know 2K loves money (VC). I dont have any NBA game,so I bought it and I'm not regret. There are a lot of negative reviews, I'm just playing MyTeam and I will just play MyTeam so I didnt see anything that bad. I almost forgot,there is no 144hz in game. How ?. In 2023 %85 of the players has 144hz or 144+hz monitors.It's not that big deal but If I have this specs,I want to use it. CPU sometimes can do odd movements like Cedi Osman posterized my Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I read too many review people wrote about game crash and bugs.At auction house, just for once, my game just crashed. If you don't have any nba game and you just want to play MyTeam and versus to your friends,you can buy.\n\n\n[b] WARNING : IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MYPARK OR MYCAREER AND YOU ARE BUYING FOR THIS PURPOSE YOU SHOULD KNOW,THIS GAME HAS NO ANTI-CHEAT !  [/b] \n\n[b] WARNING 2 : IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY CONTROLLER DEVICE, DONT BUY THIS GAME. AT THE ENTERANCE GAME GIVING ADVICE ABOUT THIS MATTER.  [/b]",

First you will have to play 2 entire 82 game seasons without skipping  to get you character to 90 without spending additional money. During those games you hope the game doesn't bug out while your on the bench and doesn't allow you to skip. Yes an Alt Tab x3 will fix this but why do i have to do that to play? The AI never does anything. Call a play and they do anything but that. The games store page works flawless though if you want to buy VC. Do better 2k.",

But when you look at it as a choice, you realize just how flawed you and the rest of humanity is.\n\nWhat drove me to purchase such a game? What part of my soul felt so empty that I thought a virtual girl could fill it?\nWhen I look into the boundless depths of my own loneliness I see a pool of reflection. My face isn't there, there is no face. There are only tears in that pool, tears of shame and loss and confusion.\n\nIf it were up to me again I know I would purchase it in a heartbeat, I know I would load it up and skip through the countless window prompts so I can have a single morsel of pornographic images which are readily available online.\nYet, despite the abundance of naked virtual women waiting in the digital sphere, I still chose to purchase this game and devote hours of my life to it. That time will never return to me, it is lost just like my soul and just like the time I fear I may never find it again.\n\nThere is something broken within me, something that desires sensation beyond my reach, something that whimpers every single night with the knowledge that there is no true Princess, it is a merely an illusion.\nIn my pursuit to find meaning in this long life, I sought the colorful lights and sounds of a world that only exists in a pop up window on my computer.\n\nI am unsure what the moral of this review is, I am unsure about my place within the universe, all I know is that no amount of virtual girls can cure the vast rot that has overtaken me.",

Released nearly a decade ago, it continues to captivate gamers worldwide with its strategic gameplay, competitive intensity, and relentless action. In this review, we delve into the elements that make CS:GO a timeless masterpiece in the world of gaming.\n\nGraphics and Visual Design:\nCS:GO may not boast cutting-edge graphics, but its visual design strikes a perfect balance between realism and accessibility. The maps are meticulously crafted, offering diverse settings ranging from sprawling urban landscapes to tightly confined interiors. While the character models may lack intricate details, their distinct silhouettes and animations enhance the tactical aspect of gameplay. Overall, the visuals effectively serve the game's purpose without compromising performance.\n\nGameplay Mechanics:\nThe gameplay mechanics in CS:GO are the heart and soul of the experience. The precise gunplay mechanics are a testament to the game's commitment to skill-based gameplay. Every shot fired requires discipline, as accuracy and recoil control are paramount. Mastering the weapon arsenal and understanding map layouts become essential components for success. The game's economy system adds an additional layer of strategy, forcing players to make crucial decisions about weapon purchases and utility usage. The intensity and satisfaction derived from clutch moments are unparalleled.\n\nCompetitive Depth:\nCS:GO thrives on its fiercely competitive ecosystem. Whether engaging in matchmaking or watching professional tournaments, the game's competitive scene is nothing short of electrifying. The depth of strategies, teamwork, and individual skill displayed at the highest level is awe-inspiring. The community's dedication to honing their craft and the constant updates from the developers ensure a dynamic meta that keeps the game fresh and engaging.\n\nEsports Influence:\nCS:GO's impact on the esports landscape cannot be overstated. It has become one of the pillars of competitive gaming, drawing massive crowds and offering enormous prize pools. The game's popularity has paved the way for legendary teams and iconic players to emerge, creating a legacy that will be remembered for years to come. The commitment from Valve to support the competitive scene has helped CS:GO maintain its status as a premier esport.\n\nCommunity and Social Interaction:\nCS:GO fosters a vibrant and passionate community that adds another dimension to the game. Whether teaming up with friends or engaging with strangers, the shared experiences and camaraderie forged in-game create lasting memories. The availability of community-created maps, skins, and mods allows players to customize their experience further. However, as with any online game, toxic behavior exists, and it's important to find a supportive group of players to fully enjoy the game.",

This is one of the best Marvel games to have ever come out and it was a true love letter to the Spider-Man fans. It was also a true achievement for the industry to accomplish since this game has so much heart put into it. This game also has a really fun and addictive game play style and has many content to explore throughout the game. Overall I would most certainly suggest this to anyone who is into any action games or is a fan of Marvel.",

I have been able to do things \"accidentally.\"  I feel like I have committed atrocities that would make a majority of people question my character.  The older I get, I feel like certain freedoms are stripped, not only physical freedoms, but mental as well.  I was able to peruse these wares in real time.  \n\nI started with the best intentions, and soon realized that the leash was off.  After I ate my first man flesh(accidentally), I realized I regained my will to pursue different avenues of this wondrous entitlement.\n\nI feel like I have been dug out of the cemented earth.  Unearthed, unscathed, I arose anew into the arms of the sun.  \n\nI no longer feared the tribals that littered the land.  I was an animal myself.  I realized that life was filled to the brim of possibilities.  \n\nI started slow, almost cautious.  It's as if my parents were silently looking over my shoulder, but alas, I had not a care in the world.\n\nIt comes in waves.  The hunger, not just for sustenance, but for trying new obstacles.  Armed with my newfound hope for the future, I built wondrous things.  With my comrades, my family, I built ungodly things.  \n\nI enhanced the human experience.  Every spear thrust, every lively spark of my stun rod, further drove me into madness.  A madness I embraced.\n\nBuilding only filled a small void, although creative, was enjoyable.  I yearned for what is best in life.\n\nIt wasn't the open steppe, or a fleet horse, or the wind in my hair.\n\nIt was.... Crush your enemies. See them driven before you. Hear the lamentations of their women.\n\nAnd to think..... I only invested $30.  What a time to be alive.\n\n\n\n",

I think in 3 months the game will be much more enjoyable and there definitely needs to be more building options. I really miss the old traps and effigies that really should've made it to this game. Also looking to see electrical engineering expanded to more than just a lightbulb, maybe spotlights? Also the attachment system is really wack, especially for the crossbow. Really looking to more formidable enemy types, too. A ranged attacker would definitely spice up gameplay with room for implementing a shield to protect from arrows, projectiles.",

And it will be very exciting the first 50% of the game. \n\nI never needed my well-developed base, which feels very disappointing.\n\nThe ending is extremely confusing and disappointing. And throughout the game you find lots of interesting mysteries that are super exciting, but they never get resolved or explained. \nI played multiplayer and we had to google to find some areas... no information helped us to find them, and trust me, we looked everywhere.\n\nSo dont buy it now for 30 USD/EUR, it is not worth it. But it will be AMAZING if they manage to connect all the loose ends.",

            "review": "To start out with, the game is still in early access so i'm kinda just whining with what comes next, but it was pretty anticlimactic. \"End boss\", aka bullet sponge, had no bad ass cut scene or any cut scene for that matter. Was nowhere near the Megan cut scene from the first game. I honestly would have enjoyed a re skinned Megan better. Finale was so blunt that me and my duo were heartily laughing at the amount of time we had to put in to the game for the basically meaningless ending. Please, Developers, I beg of you with my heart and soul, make the ending better, make the end boss have a cut scene, add more in-depth lore, do something to make this game special. It has so much potential riding from the first game. In the end, even though it was a pretty bad finale experience, I'll give it a thumbs up for the sole reason of the feeling that i got when i first loaded up the game and saw the lush forest and shimmering water. It felt surreal. Maybe not worth the hours of walking back and forth around the island, but worth the wait. Good job to the developers for making one of the most aesthetic games I've played. Cant wait to see how the game develops in the future!!",

However, it soon becomes apparent that this survival game lacks any real depth, content, and its abysmal AI implementation only adds to the frustrations. Its not even close to the first game and lacks a lot of features that were present there.\n\nDevelopers claimed the story is playable from start to end, but not only is the story itself terrible, but it is shockingly short, leaving players feeling cheated and unsatisfied. Hopefuly they will improve it with updates just like they did with their first game.\n\nWait for Full Release\n\n",

We spent 41 hours (50 Days in game) of searching and playing this game. We've had to BACK TRACK everywhere we explored to make progress in this cluster butt of a game. Just to disconnect from the host in the bunker and have to BACK TRACK AGAIN??? NOPE I uninstalled this game and came straight here to leave my review. These features should have been in the game DAY ONE! I wanted this game to be good SOOO bad! When we finally came back to play this game after taking a break I was excited for the new things they added. But once I realized these new features could have been in the game since day one I was annoyed and disappointed. TRY AGAIN....",

            "review": "My friends and I really loved the original Forest but we were all disappointed with this early access release and I cannot recommend the game in it's current state.  They expanded the surface footprint of the island compared to the first game while decreasing the size, number, and complexity of the cave systems. The result is a game that feels huge and empty. There isn't nearly enough there to discover and what there is feels small and disjointed. In the first game, you could travel in any direction on the surface and discover something to explore and these sites could be explored in pretty much any order. In this game they have to lead you to sites with map markers because the overworld is too big. Then when you get there you will find that you are missing a piece of equipment gating off that area from being explored. Time trudge to the next map marker through vast empty landscape. When you do get past gates the caves and complexs beneath the land are linear, fairly short, and isolated from eachother. Every location seams to be a loop that returns the player to the entrance through a contrived way. Gone are the interconnected caves and dense world that made the original work so well. The game is in early access so I don't expect it to be totally finished but what the publisher claims in the early access statement is completely inaccurate. They say: “In addition to bug fixes and improvements on balance and core gameplay, we plan to add more items, more things you can 3d print, more to build and discover, as well as adding additional game mechanics and lore.” If this is all they plan to do the game is a disaster, because it will not address the core issues that make the sequel inferior to the original. I have finished all the content in the game at this point and watched the updates to see is there is any hint at the issues I see being addressed but the updates have been only adding small incremental fixes and items that are largely unimportant. I fear the problems are baked in at this point but will check back when the game reaches full release.  I recommend skipping this game until full release and check reviews at that time!",

But this? This is from what I've been able to play an amazing chunk of content. Interesting stories, a fun new class to play ass, cool characters, a stunning new part of the world to explore, and many neat little collectibles to earn really make me think that this is a good new direction for the game to take. More of this please! \n\nOh, and thanks for supporting Tales of Tribute, the Card-game added in High Isle. I LOVE this game and today I was pleasantly surprised to find that Necrom also adds a new Deck to play with. Can't wait to unlock that. :D",

            "review": "TLDR down below.\n\nBest shooter roguelike out there.\n\nHas everything a modern roguelike should have: \n\n- Multiple characters that feel unique:\n Every character has multiple styles of play. You can focus on one of their 2 special abilities or on abilities that improve your weapons. But this is not required, you can use a bit of all 3 styles and still feel strong. Most characters gravitate to certain kinds of weapons with which they will probably do best. All characters have 3 trees of 6 power ups that you can pick from after you finish a stage.\n\n- a lot of different weapons to get:\nThere are over 50 weapons divided into 8 classes. Most weapons feel unique and have their own gimmick. You can carry up to 2 weapons making certain combo's is possible. A downside with such a big selection is of course that some weapons feel like weaker versions of others. Also each weapon being pretty unique means that some will not be suited to your style at all. \n\n- Permanent upgrades:\nThere is permanent progression between runs you can upgrade with a currency you get by playing. I know this goes against the definition of roguelike but all modern rogues have this feature. The devs can make harder/more fun encounters that feel unfair but get less unfair the more you invest in this system which ultimately makes the game better since they can push the boundaries the game. You can also go for an extra challenge by not/ partially investing in this to make it harder for yourself.\n\n- Difficulty settings:\n\nThere are 4 difficulties to play in. You are locked to normal at the start but unlock higher difficulties by beating the hardest difficulty you currently have. The 4th difficulty is the most unique, it features unique upgrades you can buy with the same currency used for the permanent upgrades (this means that currency is not useless when you unlocked the whole prema upgrades tree which is nice) which will change the way you play in a major way and is so much fun! The game never feels to unfair, you can win the game with any combination of weapons/power ups as long as you can keep dodging!\n\n- Many upgrades\nDuring the run you encounter these power ups called occult scrolls, they can straight up boost your damage/survivability or change the way you play. Some boost you in a big way but will also restrict you in a way, there is a lot of different 'builds' you can aim to go for.\n\n- 4 worlds to go through, with their own enemies to fight.\nThe enemies are cool, there is ranged and melee enemies. Some have unique mechanics that are not super hard to play around. Of course this gets harder when it's accompanied by other enemies. Enemies get harder in the later worlds, it's not uncommon to almost get oneshot there. The bosses of these areas are also very good. Huge monsters in their own arena with alot of different attacks that have to be dealt with, and somewhere in between you are supposed to actually kill them.\n\n- Active devs\nThe game still gets regular patches and updates, there is still a roadmap for their future content like in the beta. They have added new characters, bosses, a new world and a new game mode since beta. There is still more to come as well. When you encounter bugs in game there is a feedback option which you can access during your run and explain the bug. And you actually get listened to, every bug I have reported over the years has been fixed in a reasonable time frame, almost always in the next patch.\n\n- Good pricing\nThis game is 100% worth getting at full price. It is more then reasonable if you see the huge amount of content here that puts AAA games to shame. There has been 1 DLC so far which included 2 characters. So far it is the only content that is gated behind a DLC, their new game mode that could have been a DLC in itself was added completely free. If you are looking for a game like this I would just buy it now!\n\n- Multiplayer\nThe game supports multiplayer, there is a matchmaker to play with random people as well. I cannot comment on the quality of that since I never did that. I have only played multi with 1 friend and it was fun, every player gets their own weapon and scroll drops so nobody can 'steal' your upgrades like in Risk of Rain 2. If you don't need your drops you can press a button to make them visible for your allies so they can pick it up. You can help each other get to their preffered build faster but you can't get 'griefed' by people that steal your drops. I feel this is the best way to create a multiplayer experience in a co-op game. The new game mode can also be played with friends. \n\nTLDR:\nif you like this genre, you should definitely buy this. Big worlds, al lot of characters, weapons and power ups. Different difficulties for everyone, a multiplayer that is done extremely well for a co-op game. The devs should feel very proud of what they accomplished with this game. I look forward to the bright future of this game!\n\nThe game has this big \"one more run\" feel that every good roguelike should have.\n\nIf I have to put a number on it it's a 9,5/10 for me. I hope this review helped any people with doubts to make a good decision!",

            "review": "Meh, I want to like this game more but it's got a lot of problems for me personally. It's not bad, I enjoy it and play it with friends or on my own occasionally but everytime I do nowadays I just end up irked over one thing or another. I could probably recommend it if you like this sort of thing, but I'd like to list out my problems as someone that's played both a lot of shooters and roguelikes/lites.\n\nAlthough I'll start with the good, the gunplay and weapon designs are incredible and a ton of fun to mess with, reincarnation is incredible too, the wacky builds you can pull off at that point are a ton of fun. That's really the main positive here, and if that's good enough for you you'll probably love this. It's great for more casual play.\n\nThe problems start with the enemies, its not necessarily their attack patterns, their hp, or anything like that. They're well balanced, but for a few reasons they don't *feel* satisfying to fight. The way they move around is kind of awkward, rigid, and janky, its not smooth at all and feels random and just frustrating enough to lower the feel of combat for me. Its not bullshit or anything, but it makes it harder to enjoy the great gunplay and with enough playtime it became harder and harder for me to overlook.\n\nThe game has a lot of content, side modes and such that might seem like nice mixups at first but it all ends up being kinda mediocre and I just end up playing reincarnation instead. Spirtual Assault is still a complete mess, its not a bullet sponge hell-hole anymore but its just soooo boring and really highlights the unsatisfying enemy design. It needs to seriously be cut down and better paced, it goes on way too long for how mindless and spammy it is. The final boss for it is designed okay move-wise but is still annoyingly tanky and unfun to fight as a result.\n\nThe further you go into the game progression wise the more of a problem the stat system becomes.  It's much better to stick with one weapon early on with good affixes and pump all the money into it. Unless you're playing a character like the dog there's little reason to ever switch between two weapons, ammo is plenty and its way too costly to invest into two weapons when you can just funnel everything into one broken one. \n\nThis isn't inherently a problem necessarily but then it leads to runs becoming samey, you're just waiting until you get an OP combination and then just spamming that weapon at enemies, it leaves the combat loop lacking depth, the only skill thats really rewarded as a result is the ability to dodge enemies. There's no major tactics here, most characters except like, the monkey, have a clearly defined weapon type/s they're good with, so thats what you go for. \n\nYou want shotguns/melee, you play the bird, you want smgs/assault rfiles play the bunny, fire weapons? the fox. I wish the characters were more open-ended in their design, would be much more interesting for builds.\n\nOverall its not a bad game, just a shallow one. Don't go into this one expecting any major complexity or depth. You shoot the bad guys, dodge occasionally, and build around whatever rng has given you. It's a passable way to spend the time, but there's both roguelites and shooters out there that offer way more depth and engaging gameplay than this if thats what you're looking for.",

All what they want from you is to consume their new overpriced CoD's, riddled with bad, rage inducing gamedesign choices and, most importantly, OVERPRICED COSMETIC BUNDLES, THAT COST ALMOST A HALF OF A WHOLE FUCKING GAME! Have you seen the recent \"premium\" battle pass? Do you think that having some gold plated animated skins is absolutely worth your money? I absolutely don't! And many other people will surely agree with me on this. Do not give these greedy, incompetent morons your (probably) hard earned money. You'd be better off spending it on other better shooters. Hell, even Battlefield 2042 might be better than this shitshow even though I've never ever tried. I really hope that my salty message will change your mind about this horrible \"game\".

            "review": "Call of Duty has officially hit rock bottom as of recently\n\nI've been a Veteran fan of the series ever since BO1 and would defend this franchise always, but after everything Activision has done to repay back to the few loyal fans of this franchise is absolutely disgusting and needs to be heard.\n\n1. When it was announced that there won't be a COD for 2023 and that MW2 will instead receive a \"Premium Expansion\", everyone thought that Activision has finally listened to us and won't be releasing another yearly COD and instead allowing a 2 year live-service into MW2 and we all believed in this title which lead to MW2 being the Number 1 best selling game in 2022. What do you do now Activision? Maybe continue the 2 year live-service to make this the best COD since BO2 and continue fixing the game? NO. Instead Activision tricked us all and changes their mind that there will be a COD in 2023 and there will no longer be a \"Premium Expansion\" but instead a standalone COD release which all of a sudden became MW3??? (Which isn't even being created by Infinity Ward but instead SLEDGEHAMMER).\n\n2. Ok so you fucked up on the 2 Year live-Service and expansion, how is MW2 been? I mean it was advertised as the most innovative and expansive COD of all time. One thing positive i can say is this game definitely had more content at launch, but still we just got yet another Incomplete game that needed more content and bug fixes and SBMM is still is a huge problem that hasn't been fixed at all. While this game has received updates, it has been done very poorly and at a snail's pace. First Warzone/DMZ wasn't even here at launch and had to take a few weeks to be added and we barely get 2 maps a season, a few game modes and a small amount of weapons in which 75% of the weapons are locked behind the battle pass and are insanely overpowered so more players buy the battle pass and instead we get more content focusing on spending money in MW2 like Battle Passes, weapon blueprints, bundles and useless skins and operators like adding Messi or TimTheTatman which seems to be more of Activision's focus instead of fixing or adding content to the game. With all the problems being said, you'd think Activision might've listened to player feedback and try to focus on fixing the game and releasing more updates right? NO. Instead Activision doubles down and releases P2W skins for DMZ making P2W players have an advantage and releasing a £25 Blackcell bundle with a battle pass, Gold skins and Cod Points whereas before that would be the price of two Black ops 1 or 2 expansions adding maps and weapons to the game, and Activision hasn't fixed it's huge problems like the game still not having content and content that should've been at launch and the game CRASHING randomly but instead ADDING more problems into the game like ruining performance for this game, it's actually shocking that COD BO2 had 300 people work on the game and that game was complete with Expansions but this game had over 3000 people working on it but yet they are all incapable and incompetent of fixing the game and releasing content which basically led to players losing interest in this game and leaving.\n\n3. With MW2 being a dumpster fire and players already leaving the game to play older COD games to have fun, what does Activision do now? They see their community and fans having fun in projects like SM2, X Labs, Plutonium or clients like BOIII or CoD 4X, you'd think they maybe should advertise their projects or support them like Valve if they are having fun right? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Activision took the biggest L and became Nintendo by basically sending cease and desist letters ordering the people behind these projects to take them down leading to projects like SM2, X Labs and the BOIII Client being gone now because Activision doesn't know how to make a good COD game and their community doing a way better job than them at making a fun game. These developers spent so much time in these projects and aren't even being paid by Activision to make these and are spending their time to create something fun so people can enjoy but Activision doesn't like to see their fans having fun so they kill their community and fans by doing disgusting tactics like this.\n\n4. The breaking point that lead to this was the security issues, apparently ALL COD GAMES have a security issue that can lead to your IP getting Stolen or your account getting hacked, yes even COD MW2 their newest game is vulnerable to this issue and Activision is doing nothing to stop this. This just proves that they don't care about us having an enjoyable experience in their games but only care when we spend money on their store, they have billions of money and developers in this game yet they continue to disappoint and not let any of their fans have fun in their games yet Indie developers are able to do 10X better than companies like Activision at offering a fun and enjoyable experience. The fact that you can't even offer the bare minimum of players being secure and safe in your NEWEST GAMES shows how Incompetent, Lazy and Out of Touch you people are in 2023.\n\nSo after everything that has happened to COD and Activision constantly screwing over their community and fans(where Activision doesn't even deserve any of their fans) We should come together and just outright boycott MW3 releasing this year, yes as much this may sound stupid or petty, Activision is a company that only cares about people buying their games and receiving money and not allowing people having fun or creating projects and quite frankly should deserve a ton of lawsuits and their acquisition with Microsoft/Xbox to fall apart since Activision does not deserve their money or being apart of Xbox. If money is all they care about and not the player enjoyment then we should at least hurt their sales for COD MW3 to show that they should care about their community and players having fun instead of continuously screwing over their fan-base by taking down projects and not prioritizing the user's safety.\n\nI miss when franchises like COD, Battlefield and Halo were good, i want to go back to those years.....",

Your time is better spent with another game.\n\nI want to like this game, but Activision sure as hell don't like us. The nasty manipulative money grubbing practices you find in here is disgraceful. Only the guns you buy with real money are good, bundles are over $20 on average and the skins are mostly trash (with a few exceptions) and the skins which are actually nice can cost upwards of $30 including tax! They do everything they can to make you want to buy guns to get the edge in a fight or buy a skin with built in killstreaks so you can fight in DMZ pay to win style!! All they do is try to trick their way into your wallet.\n\nTHEN on top of that, the maps are subpar, oddly small with no thought put into spawns or spawn camping, flow of the game, movement, shooting, sniping, ANYTHING! There are 10 different game modes which are all just search and destroy with different names...... why?! The cheaters are rampant and blatant, not even trying to hide, and why would they? Reporting and anti cheat do literally nothing. People literally stream this game cheating and going \"Yeah they'll never do anything about it\".\n\nI miss the good ol days when I would jump on COD with a few buds and have 'fun'. \"Maybe one of us will get a nuke.\"  or  \"OH WORD LET'S GO!! I GOT DOGS\"  or  \"Hey, who want's to try some dumb strat just for fun!\" \n\nNow it's \"Hey I'm on COD.... I'm just on to make some battlepass progress... No I'm not playing warzone or DMZ that shits full of hackers\"  or  \"Dude why do some of these guns shoot nerf darts, I've hit this guy with half my mag!\"  or  \"Dude even this guy's team is reporting him for cheating and nothing is being done\"  or  \"No I only play shipment 24/7. Less cheaters and less game time so I can get off cod faster after grinding some battlepass xp\"\n\nThat last quote makes me the saddest. No one I know plays cod for fun anymore... we treat it like a job because we spent money on it and don't want to admit that what we did..... was a waste. And I know that I'll play it again because I want to spend time with my friends... I just wish we had a better game to spend time together on. \n\nI know I'm just one guy, so when I say \"I am never buying another COD unless they fix these problems and go back to making the game FUN and not an AFK money farm for their corporate masters\"  It's got all the threat of a growling puppy. But it's all I got. I've been burned too many times by these people, and these days... money is too tight to be spending it on a headache. \n\nI ask you, please, don't waste your time or money here. There are plenty of other games and companies worth your time and money. This game is nothing but an exercise in frustration and manipulative legal robbery.",

Because the game used to be good, and i felt like i was supporting that. But in all honestly i was contributing to a greater problem. This game has become nothing more than a cash grab. the quality of the content has gone down hill and they care very little for quality of life applications. Everything in the crown store, including the crowns themselves, is over priced. which makes it no surprise that the in-game currency has lost its value exponentially. Forced and unnecessary rarity of resources breed toxic behavior, and with pricing of items, including those needed for common crafting skyrocketing to astronomic proportions makes it as much or more of a grinding slog to acquire the money than it is to get the actual items. Also inventory space is locked behind a paywall, either with large amounts of in-game money or with actual money, and any attempt to dedicate to any crafting is impossible without the extra space locked behind the monthly pass subscription. Simply put, the game is designed to be unplayable without sinking endless funds into dwindling phoned in content.",

The controller support in accessibility mode works well and we have text to speech, but only in chats.\nWhat would make this better for the visually impaired?\nI have two items on my wishlist if any Devs are listening:\nEzpand text to speech to all text in game, this would be a massive help in the inventory and other menues.\nThe more difficult one, but I still feel it's possible, is to have a Scout. Here's the plan, in it's basic form it would call out to help you pin point the direction you should be heading. This will get you to the map marker you are targetting, a boon. They can also tie into the perks you get guiding you to any plants, ore veins etc that you find whilst on your travels. Spotting range based on level of perk.\nThere would still be the odd quest that would be problematic, but the above would make things so much better when soloing.\nUntil then if you see someone walking into walls in town or trees in the wilds, it may be me. Say hi.\nOh and if there is anyone who fancies helping someone who is Visually Impaired out in game drop me a message. I would love to set up a guild with people willing to help and gather others who are also visually impaired under the guilds wing..... I can dream.\nOh and did I mention, I really like the game.",

            "review": "The moment you've experienced a game where every single dialogue is voiced, other games might just start to pale in comparison. Yes, even that inconspicuous NPC in the most remote corner of the game world is professionally voice acted. Each corner of this game world unfolds a new story, an adventure lurking at every turn. Just pick a direction and start running; lend your ears to the happenings around you and before you know it, you're caught up in some dramatic quest, helping others or overcoming some danger. Suddenly, it's 2:00 AM, and you're contemplating if you should dive into one last dungeon before getting some shut-eye for work the next day.\n\nThere's something for every type of player. Love to jump into a quick PvP? The battleground's got your back. Want to wage wars and sieges over vast terrains? Cyrodil is the place to be. Prefer a medium-scale mix of PvE/PvP gameplay style? Try out Imperial City. If PvE dungeons are your thing, there's a whole range from easy to super tough, including normal, veteran, and trial dungeons. For explorers, hundreds of places across dozens of maps are waiting to be discovered, complete with numerous world bosses, delves, and public dungeons. If you fancy a solo single-player experience, you can have it your way. Tired of the classic Warrior, Rogue, Mage classes? Feel free to wield a sword and shield while conjuring spells. Your proficiency grows with whatever weapon you choose to master. Played Skyrim and miss it for nostalgia's sake? You'll find Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and more. Whether you want to be a thief or a killer, it's all up to you.\n\nAre there downsides? Sure, the company may appear a bit greedy with its loot boxes and the need to purchase new chapters with real money. However, all the other DLCs in the game can be indirectly purchased with gold. Once you've got the hang of the game, earning gold becomes child's play.\n\nMoreover, the versatility of gameplay this title offers is truly astounding. Crafting enthusiasts can lose themselves in extensive crafting systems, designing weapons, armor, or even brewing potions. For the lore lovers, there are countless books, scrolls, and notes scattered throughout the game world, revealing rich backstories and hidden secrets. Social butterflies will appreciate the in-depth interaction systems, allowing forming alliances, trading, or just enjoying a chit-chat around the in-game taverns.\n\nIn a nutshell, this game doesn't just offer an RPG, it presents a living, breathing world that's waiting for you to leave your mark.",

            "review": "If you're looking for an MMO with clear love and care put into every inch of it, then look no further. With goals, consistent pacing, incredible voice acting as well as smooth and varied combat, in the 400 hours I've put into this game I've hardly scratched the surface. However incredible this game is, it's never without flaw.\n\nFor one, the base game - whilst still incredibly vast and intricate, can be somewhat limiting without ESO+. Some dungeons and rooms will bear striking resemblance from Grahtwood to Reaper's March, but it's not enough of an issue to be overbearing. \n\nSome aspects of the game encourage routine or obsession - i.e daily login rewards.\n\nBasic recipes and unlockables do not transfer between characters, though styles do.\n\nWithout guidance, some classes can be a bit of a drag.\n\nThere are items that boost stats by a small amount for a limited time that you can purchase for real money, but frankly almost everything you yourself can make will always be better.\n\nI've found coming into this game to have expectations - I jumped in blind and still had an amazing time - but know that this game -is- at it's prime when you are subbed to ESO+. Trust me when I say that it, at the very least, gives you a bang for your buck. For as long as you're subbed, you get every bit of DLC and crowns to spend on fun cosmetics in the store. \n\nThe DLCs and lands beyond are where this game hits it's stride. Elsweyr, Summerset Isles, Morrowind, Skyrim, High Isles, all of it. The stories are so vast, incredible, and grasping without teetering off of cool aesthetics and gameplay vibes. \n\nSPOILER:\nI was walking through the desert jungle in Northern Elsweyr. I heard a Khajiit calling out to me, the voice actor clearly being Liam O'Brien. Of course, I paused in my journey to hear what the cat-fursona of Illidan Stormrage needed, and he was panicked and frustrated about his temple's acolytes being utterly entranced and insane by something. Travelling to this gorgeous view, we're met with some little Alfiq named 'Skooma Cat'. He makes some little remarks, cackling and giggling before leading us to the temple, to where the priestess is perched on the ledge, gigging and crying out about how throwing herself off would let her see what their lunar gods had in store as for salvation. Turns out, Sheogorath had taken control of the temple for fun, and we have to play his game to get them unstuck.\n\nThis was an optional, very easily avoided side quest. There are hundreds of these everywhere, with plots thick and writing sublime.\n\nI highly recommend this game. It can be played easily as a casual player or sweaty if you're feeling hardcore.",

            "review": "I don't believe this game would even be alive today if it weren't for the fact that \"Elder Scrolls\" is in the title. The combat doesn't feel good, it's very floaty and lacks impact. The majority of quests are boring, the game is absurdly easy to the point that you could set up a program to just play it for you and spam you through the 90% of the game with zero interaction from the player. It's basically a game that could have an auto-play function dropped right into it as far as difficulty goes. (High tier end game/PVP being the only exception, which doesn't erase the fact that a vast majority of the game is mind numbing easy)\n\nOn top of this, the game is absurdly expensive and has zero respect for your time and money. The cash shop is filled with optional purchases that sells fixes for problems the developers created, or to just outright skip the grind. There's also gambling in the form of loot boxes with drop rates IRL Casinos wish they could get away with. There's a monthly sub on top of being required to purchase the latest expansion each release. Without the monthly sub the game will effectively attempt to annoy you and cheapen your experience just to entice you to purchase a sub.\n\nThe grind to get anything particularly worthwhile will probably take you months, in the most extreme cases you'll be grinding for a year for a single mount.\n\nThe only thing ESO has going for it is that it's set in the Elder Scrolls universe, and that's the only reason the game didn't die years ago as an over monetized, boring cash grab like the dumpster fire it is. If this game had been released by a studio that no one had every heard of and not Bethesda, no one would be praising it.",

Then we graduated and still play the game as well, most of us have 2000-3000 hours of play time.\nA few days ago, 8 of my friends' accounts were suddenly banned, which is ridiculous. A group of people who logged into the game and used oak soul ring and held the left button and didn't let go to finish the daily game, then looked at the appearance of dressing up, building houses, and going to relax would be banned?\nWe rarely play eso in the last 1 month, some people have not logged into eso in a month, I don't know what the reason is, customer service work orders reply for different reasons for everyone, there is a guy whose entire property is not more than 2m who received a banning email for selling gold, Lmao, and someone else showed the email title is eso content is fo76 banning notice from the eso team.\nIt's crazy, and there are bad bot support replies where they just change a few of the sentences and keep sending them to you, forcing you to accept the result.\n\nI suspect it's because they all use the ip provided by the internet acceleration provider, and there are other people in the same ip that violated the regulations.\nNot all places are that good, no network acceleration service to connect na server will have 300+ ping\nAFAIK, this has been happening every June for the past few years, and false bans due to network acceleration services are common in other games as well.\n\nOne of them was lucky enough to meet human support and unblocked.\nBut the others are still in the same bad situation, emails from support will only repeat the last words or not reply to the email at all\nThey are still waiting for the result of the process, which is a painfully long process, and this emotion spreads to me.\n\nI don't know if eso's anti-cheat system is as reliable and efficient as eac and battleye's. The people in charge of anti-cheat bans are so lazy that they could always, continuously check if the players are normal and violate the rules, they could check the players' data, they could track and eventually ban the real violators and protect the normal players.\nHowever they choose to block a large number of people with suspicions in a concentrated period of time, one of the multiple users from the same ip has a problem, then it is quite possible that other users also have problems, and then slowly rank them? I don't know what they will do.\nMaking a mass error ban in a long-running, role-playing game that requires a lot of time and effort to be put into it would only shatter the player's illusion of the game, realizing that his dedication is meaningless and that everything precious to him could suddenly fade away\nWhy don't we make an announcement in advance that playing eso between April and June and logging into the game has a lottery with a chance of getting banned\n\nWouldn't think that players who have gone through this kind of thing would come back to play the game after their accounts are eventually unblocked, right?\nThere are so many good games out there, who will continue to play your sh*t game?\n\nPut these normal players into the June banning of a large number of illegal players news bulletin\nGood job zos",

            "review": "I haven't been very far through the game as for what I could see after 59 long hours was : \n- too much boring quests\n- I don't really like the fact that everybody is the main character and, even though I really like the dragon break theory, it's a hard to swallow pill\n- constant inconcistencies\n- first quest log entry for the main quest spoiling the conclusion of that said quest and that is a major bad point I think as it shows some huge negligeance\n- horrifying low difficulty when questing\n- repetitive combat system that really drives you to alienation\n- towns filled up with other players \"pets\"\n- esthetically over the top mounts\n- immersion breaking silly cosmetic rewards worn by so many other players\n\nI found it really hard to play, and as I said, not because of difficulty, but because it is painful, to the eyes as well as to the mind. I know that it's supposed to become more interessant when you reach a high enough level to do high difficulty group dungeons or pvp, but seriously, if you have to go through all of that, as far as I'm concerned, it's not worth the effort. \n\nThe other issues in the game are shared with many other games because it's a structural issue in the game industry : \n- you have to pay for everything. You have bought Elseyr chapter but you want to visit both areas of Elseyr ? Well, you have to buy the DLC for that other half of said region\n- excessive fan service conflicting with clumsy attempts to expand the audience\n\nFinally, let's speak about the good aspects of the game because there are some : \n- high enough level of character personalization\n- nice setting (main quest plot, era, general context)\n- very nice natural sceneries\n- well designed towns\n- some fun NPC's\n- some quests are not boring and let you discover some aspects of the lore\n- I don't like crafting but those who do may find it quite diversed and rewarding\n- nice ideas underlying the class combat system (but is it well executed ? I think not)\n- fun bestiary\n\nIn conclusion, I would qualify the game as being a gauche chimera forcefully bending and twisting the Elder Scrolls universe to fit in a not so well designed mmorpg.",

            "review": "I love this game a lot, it is one of my favorite MMO's of all time. If you are a casual player and don't care for PvP/Endgame PvE, this is a great MMORPG for you, especially if you like the Elder Scrolls universe. Although the ESO Plus membership is not required to experience the full game, if you plan on playing ESO as your main MMO you are definitely going to want to get it as it allows for you to carry unlimited crafting materials, and unlock all the DLCs for the game for however long you have ESO plus, and much more. \n\nThe Pros: The solo story is awesome and engaging. The world is huge and consists of almost every part of Tamriel (Yes, you can visit Skyrim). Dungeons are so fun and the raids are even better. There are also solo/group arenas that can prove to be quite challenging. The different bosses and mechanics that come with them can be very challenging and rewarding, getting you different gear sets, armor/weapon motifs, titles, etc. Classes are pretty standard MMO classes. You have your tanks, DPS, and healer classes. You can also choose your race but it doesn't mean to much unless you are trying to maximize stats. The leveling system, gear system, and character customization is perfect in my opinion. It is simplistic yet diverse and allows for multiple different builds and looks for your character. Mounts in the game look awesome but could definitely be better. From what I have experienced, the community of this game is amazing. I have met nothing but generous and wholesome people on this game, whether it be from trading, dungeon running, raids, guilds etc (PvP community is horrible). Expansions and DLCs are unique and are honestly required to experience the full beauty of ESO. They add lots of new zones to explore, gear to achieve and storylines/bosses to complete. The graphics are also better than any MMO on the market that is actually fun to play, however that doesn't matter much to me when looking at games but it is a plus. Performance is also pretty decent, I have never crashed or had any crazy frame drops but I do have a super PC so take that with a grain of salt. The game also allows addons which can be very useful depending on what you use. The PvP in this game is some of the most fun I have had in an MMO by far. \n\nThe Cons: ZeniMax Online Studios are one of the biggest clowns in the gaming industry. The development team behind this game, primarily the leads who make the big decisions have no business being at the positions they are in. All they care about is money. This game is so predatory to new players in terms of how the in-game shop works, not to mention the loot crates. For example, almost all of the mounts within this game have to be bought using either real money, using gems which you earn from salvaging items from loot crates, or currency from daily/weekly missions which can take months, maybe even years to achieve for ONE mount. There are only a few mounts which can be earned through actually playing the game, which are extremely difficult to attain even as an endgame player and don't even look that appealing. The monetization is just blatantly obvious that they do not care about player satisfaction. Not to mention that they have also banned users on their forums who raise concern about said issues. The servers are absolutely terrible. They attempted to fix them but somehow made it worse. This results in PvP/PvE being a laggy mess. Not being able to cast a skill or use a potion in certain scenarios is the difference between life and death. They could easily fix the server with the amount of money they make, but they don't care. Not to mention the hundreds of bugs that have still not been fixed for years, some even game breaking, but don't worry they added a new house that costs $200 USD. The toxic and unprofessional nature of the development team of ZOS is why I am giving this a bad review. They do not care about the players, they only care about the casuals money. I could go on and on but I don't think steam will allow me to write that much.\n\nConclusion: The core game has the potential to be one of the best MMORPGs on the market, but the lack of a professional and passionate development team is why this games player base has dropped tremendously over the years. If you don't care about endgame content, you will love ESO and by all means, you should play it because you will enjoy it if you are an Elder Scrolls fan. However, if you are a hardcore gamer and want to go for the crazy endgame PvE titles, gear, achievements, and climb the PvP ladder, avoid at all costs because the developers could care less about you and just want your wallet.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrLS3ROGw_A",

The game is unreliable at best. Every update breaks something and fixes take too long to implement. After half the endgame community quit last year it's even more frustrating to play because new players have to learn how to play from veteran players, the game doesn't teach anyone how the multiplayer mechanics work like roles. So much unpaid labour by the players, whether in guilds or otherwise, and if we ask the devs questions on the forums like \"do you have an update on this bug fix?\" they may or may not respond. When I quit it was because blocking damage was bugged for months, and at the moment Crown crate gifting has been broken for months. Guilds use these as prizes and incentives, to raise funds for bidding on ridiculously expensive guild traders. After this much dev hostility towards the player base for this long, I'm out. I probably won't be back and that sucks because this was my favourite game and I met some really good people playing it. I'd bet a lot of money the Necrom release is going to be the worst game-breaking update yet. Spend your money elsewhere, somewhere it's put back into maintaining the game.",

I fell in love with Sims 2 back in the day but even that much older game felt like it had more “soul” than this empty husk of a game. \n\nDo I recommend it? Since it’s now free, sure. Why not check it out…but I will say that the fact that the base game is so shallow while a good deal of DLC is $30-$40 each doesn’t sit right with me. They even charge you $10 for the “privilege” of doing laundry. Take that as you may.",

They have COUNTLESS bugs and problems with each DLC that breaks the game in some way, shape or form. EA do NOT care about the player at all when it comes to THE SIMS all they care about is lining their own pockets with our HARD EARNED CASH.",

It was like the entire village i was in was changing along with the Sims I cared for. The Sims 4 is bland even with expansion packs. Believe me they will not fill the void left by the Sims 3. I have spent over 100+ dollars on some of the more higher rated packs and they really just don't fix the Sims 4 main problem, the Sims themselves. I might try to wait till sims 3 is on sale and get the entire pack that way. Sims 4 is a hard pass I promise. Do not spend your money on this product. Wait till Sims 5 or go replay Sims 3.",

The fact they also made it free makes no sense, it already costs a bunch to buy the game itself, I have the disc still but then it wouldn't work properly so I couldn't play it for a while. And had to also get it on steam, but now to hear it's basically free. Irritates me. And also yes the school pack and some packs are nice, I do enjoy them but they aren't worth how much they cost, yes you get a cool new map, new interactions, items and clothes. But honestly I recommend just getting custom content, despite I like the game and do enjoy it I really just hate how it's going, EA. You have lots of money, stop overpricing things.. Of course everyones choice to get the game but I honestly feel like I've been scammed?",

            "review": "The best designed characters so far. Zi Xiao is really unique and a ton of fun with the potential for tons of crazy builds. Nona is really fun for solo play but also as a more supportive character in multiplayer, too.\n\nLess positive on the weapons but they're pretty alright, the main stand out is the absurdity that is the brick, which manages to be very fun and powerful. Wolf Gaze and Star Ring are pretty decent, the star ring is a little weird but good for crowd control. Do not get the jet octopus's role at all though, its soooo sluggish, by the time I get it charged i probably could've killed the enemy already with any other weapon. It definitely needs tweaking imo.\n\nThe main gripe with this DLC is, and I feel bad for saying this, is the descriptions. It's always been a problem in the game that generally eventually gets fixed down the line, but my god it's at the worst here with Zi Xiao. I could not pick up on ANYTHING that he did until I found a handy guide that someone wrote. Important mechanics unmentioned or not properly described that are critical to playing the character right, and it just expects the player to somehow know.\n\nNormally the confusion stems from the issues that come with translation, but in this case its different. I feel like even in the original language, unless it was drastically rewritten, itd have the same problem of just... leaving critical information out. They need to rework how they relay this information to allow for more visual examples and showcasing passive or more intricate abilities if they're gonna be making these characters more complex and interesting like this. (Which is a good thing that they are!) It was a problem with Xing Zhe in the last dlc to a lesser extent too. I have to look on the wiki to know what each effect does, and if there is a way to see any of what i'm talking about, the game does not communicate it properly at all.\n\nI can definitely recommend this DLC if you're a fan of the basegame, regardless.",

            "review": "All Orcs Must Die games have been one of the best Tower Defense games made. Didn't seem like their heart was in OMD3 and seemed to be a fast cash game (maybe to support another game) that hasn't changed much since OMD2. It's a fun game for a few months at most, but the additional subject matter that was added to this game is lacking. I think most players noticed this after posting a good review, but didn't take the time to revise their review, because of the state of games today. If we had any other similar game options to compare, we would have noticed how little OMD3 has improved. \n\nUnchained had many issues, but this game seems to have a lot of the same and a few new issues. Adding more orcs on the screen at one time was nice (for a few maps) but most of the maps are small without much strategy or manipulating needed at all. Teamwork was much better in Unchained and I didn't feel like another game publisher was out to get more money than the game was worth. Seems the only thing this game did to make the maps \"hard\" was add more life and greatly increase the speed of the orcs. This made some of the smaller maps seem like the orcs were running faster than the heroes. Don't get me started on the lack of money we started with. Can't give us much money to buy traps when the maps are so small and boring. The 'good o' days' of gaming is lost with the must pay more for DLC (just to be a full game) or pay-to-win styles that have taken over.",

            "review": "When I started playing this game, all of its problems drove me nuts.  (Most of the negative comments and issues described in the other reviews are accurate.)  But nevertheless, after a while I was hooked.  The setting is appropriately grimdark, the music is great, the combat is a lot of fun, and although there are only a few classes there is a lot of customization available to keep things interesting.  The dialogue is inane, but this is Warhammer; what else would you expect?  Some of the voice acting is hideously awful though.  It sounds like one of the devs recruited their middle-school kids to do it between dinner and homework.  The main story and sidequests are engaging, and the random missions are fun for multiple replays.  Co-op is available, and has an auto-leveling feature.  PvP is supposedly available, but I never have tried it.  There are co-op and PvP lobbies available, and joinable \"cabals\", but these features appear to be pretty dead at present.  The devs made a serious effort to overhaul the game after its initial mediocre reviews, but it's pretty clear that they've moved on so not much more will happen with the game. \n\nIf you like \"Grim Dawn\" or \"Torchlight 2\" you will probably like this game.  I really can't speak for Diablo fans because I didn't like it, but it's the same general concept so if you liked Diablo there's a good chance it will interest you.  Also, if you like the Warhammer 40,000 universe, it captures that atmosphere and should appeal to you on that level.  It has a lot of problems that the other reviews describe in detail, so you should definitely wait for a Steam sale.  (And although I don't have the \"Sororitas\" DLC, it is clearly not worth full price because there is no additional content, aside from the class itself.)  The Emperor Protects!\n\nEDIT: I should add that a really fun feature is the destructibility of various objects and terrain features.  Eldar shooting at you from behind barrels?  Blast the barrels out of the way!  Tyrannids under a pillar?  Bring it down on top of them!  Just in a bad mood and got a big gun? Destroy everything you can!  Also, the smaller terrain features often have rewards when destroyed.  Usually it's only a bit of money, but sometimes you can find  health, supplies or equipment.  Long Live The Imperium!",

            "review": "A quick overview of the game's post-release evolution. When this game released, it felt very sluggish  - moving, engaging, looting all felt slow. The devs did a massive overhaul of combat, increasing movement speed, combat moves and cooldowns, and there are simple loot filter and auto-pickup options (neither of which need to be enabled. They are off by default). This level of attention after the release of the game, when other devs might have moved on, is remarkable to me. They took a game that was Not Bad and made it into something very memorable to me.\n\nAfter that overhaul, seasons with unique season mechanics began. These have unique mechanics that cause enemies and/or anomalies to appear in normal missions and interacting with these give you progress toward season-specific boss missions. The season will also have a new type of affix that can now appear on weapons (such as one affix that allows you to release lightning on hit or being hit while other affixes combine to make it chain longer or do more damage, etc). There are also the equivalent of runewords (psalm-code doctrines) and the components can be removed at any time and leave both the item and components intact for use in other gear.\n\nThe sound is good, especially the fighting sounds of guns, melee, fire, explosions and more. There's nothing like jump packing into a mob that explodes as you use a las cannon or flamer to melt the survivors. The story is fine though nothing to write home about. Leveling is steady even at higher levels, making the tarot cards that give extra XP feel like viable options.\n\nThere are a couple options for endgame. You can continue regular missions (of which there are 10 types) that you can do to earn gear and reputation in the respective systems (of which there are 20). Acquiring reputation unlocks additional systems and, more importantly, tarot cards. Tarot cards are the difficulty + reward multipliers for any endgame map. A card will specify the type of negative and positive it will give you - I.E. melee enemies get a random damage or defensive buff but you have a chance to double the end-of-mission rewards. Some tarot cards also raise the area level until it is many above your own, allowing the game to continue scaling after level 100.\n\nThere are also random intel missions which are short quest chains with a reward at the end and it provides you 2-3 mission types to choose from at each step.\n\nThe main endgame option is Void Crusades. There are 9 different ones, each with its own static map creating a web that connects the nodes. You can path through the web differently depending on if you want the maximum reward chests at the end or if you want to save the nodes that raise the difficulty of all remaining levels so that you have an easier run overall.\n\nI haven't touched on many things like the solid crafting/rerolling system (you can modify all but one class of item as many times as you want) or character classes (3 base classes with 3 specializations each in Inquisitor, the WH40K:Inquisitor - Prophecy stand-alone game has another campaign and character with it that can also be used in this game, and the Sororitas DLC that came out recently is a 5th class (class only, no new campaign/missions).\n\nI've played this game on and off for years. I never bought into the random negativity in the discussion board. I just get on for a few weeks at a time and have fun purging heretics, xenos, and daemons.",

            "review": "I unfortunately ultimately can't recommend the game, even though it has a lot going for it. Leveling up, going through the campaign, playing all of the classes, are all fun to do. I love the Warhammer 40k setting, but the game really falls apart at endgame.\n\nTo put it into perspective, this is the first season I participated in and the first time I fully completed the campaign. After putting in 160 hrs into this season, I still haven't had the one piece of armour with the enchant I need on it to finish my basic build. The make matters worse, it is of a rarity type that you aren't able to reroll the enchant in hopes of getting to one you need. The chances of finding a specific type of armour with the exact enchant you need is astronomical. \n\n  I also have not yet been able to complete the last seasonal goal of upgrading a tarot card to level 3. The reason for this is that if you upgrade your tarot cards when you can, as a player would naturally do, you have just added weeks, months, or even years to your grind without knowing it. The only way you can avoid that is to stumble upon a new player tips guide or forum post somewhere before you make that mistake. It also means that when I unlock a new type of tarot card from gaining reputation in a star system, I'm not happy about it, but get angry because they just instantly added another week to the grind. I ended up adding weeks of extra RNG to my tarot card upgrading before I found out how the system works. \n\nI can say I will not participate in endgame again, as the amount of RNG and grind is unreal. It rivals any mobile game, but in mobile games at least people have the option to pay to speed up their progress and not spend months or years grinding it out. Whoever runs the maths on this stuff is so out of touch with reality.",

Captures the grim dark from the far future like few others were able to. \nThe story was well thought and the variety of warhammer assents are pretty solid. \nNeocore has done a nice job in keeping the support , with seasons, events, etc.\nMy sole complaint is that i cant use the techpriest from their \"standalone\" expansion on the martyr quest story.\nOther than that, its a pretty compelling ARPG.\n",

I have slept with my headset on every night for the past 3 years causing the bone structure in my skull to be permanently damaged. I get 3 and a half hours of sleep every night which resulted in a rare disorder where my height is stunted and i am unable to digest food. I weigh about 75 pounds and im 4'3\". I hear echoes from the depths of hell, grabbing at my ankles to drag me down to the demons that i have upset in my past life. My walls scream at me as I beam ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the top of oil rig. I hear footsteps when i sleep and the explosions of rockets haunt my nightmares. every therapist and doctor ive seen has tried to lock me into a psych ward, but you are not allowed to bring in electronics, so there is no way to see if I am being raided and I will miss at least three force wipes (months for normies) which is completely unacceptable. I fear now more than ever that my sins will catch up to me, and I will live a life down bad and #PrimLocked in the darkest pit of the universe with nothing but the rust theme song repeating in my ears over and over and over and over again. 5/10 its worth it if you get it at sale.",

            "review": "Playing rust is like going on a happy camping trip into the wilderness with your friends, except this time instead of enjoying the great outdoors, you're constantly being attacked by bears, or just getting shanked by naked kids. When you log into Rust don't expect to encounter a great world of adventure and excitement because it will be disrupted instantly by a pack of naked annoying kids running around with a rock screaming into their mic's like crazy Chimpanzee's, let's just say the real game becomes trying to avoid them. Me Personally I love the feeling of anxiety that comes with logging into rust after a long day of work wanting to have a great time and wondering whether my beloved base has been taken over by a gang of naked marauders while i was away. It's almost like a surprise party, only you never know if you're going to get cake or get murdered by these wild naked creatures. But fear not, nothing says \"fun\" like constantly wondering if these naked wild creatures are going to come and ruin everything you've worked so hard for, If that sounds like a good time, then Rust is the game for you! :)",

            "review": "As a big fan of survival games, Rust is definitely one of my favorite games.  It offers a unique blend of intense PvP combat, resource gathering, base building, and a persistent open world that constantly challenges your survival skills.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around survival and interaction with other players. Starting with nothing but a rock and a torch, you must scavenge for resources, build shelter, hunt for food, and defend yourself against the hostile environment and other players. The game's emphasis on player interaction adds a unique dynamic to the experience. You can form alliances, trade goods, or engage in brutal battles for territory and resources. The unpredictability of encounters with other players keeps you on edge, as you never know whether someone will offer assistance or pose a threat.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that Rust is not without its flaws. The game has a steep learning curve, which can be overwhelming for new players. The lack of tutorials or guidance can make the initial experience frustrating and confusing. Additionally, the community can be hostile at times, with griefers and toxic players disrupting the gameplay. It's advisable to find a reliable group of friends or join a community server to enhance your enjoyment and mitigate these issues.  Rust is not a game for those seeking a casual experience. The game demands a significant time investment and rewards those who are willing to dedicate themselves to its demanding gameplay loop. Sometimes can be so addictive, affecting your own lifestyle and sometimes even your mental health, so be careful when you fall into the deep waters.\n\nDespite its flaws, Rust remains a must-play for survival game enthusiasts. Its intense gameplay, immersive world, and intricate mechanics create an addictive experience that keeps players coming back for more. Whether you're a lone wolf looking for a challenge or prefer teaming up with friends to conquer the unforgiving landscape.",

As you walk around just chopping trees and mining rocks living a peaceful life you get shot down by a player with a machine gun. This game would be good if it wasn't full of toxic players who only find joy in killing everyone. They cheated their way to the top by killing innocent players and naked men/women. Rust is where you go to meet the degenerates of society who would love if we lived in a world where they could kill with no regard or punishment. There needs to be incentive to players who want to not play GTA or provide help to players. I once gave someone resources and they literally shot me down because they wanted my axe and pickaxe. Which had they asked me to build one for them I would have.",

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\n2. Season the beef tenderloin with salt and pepper.\n3. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the beef and sear on all sides until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and let cool.\n4. Spread the Dijon mustard over the cooled beef tenderloin.\n5. In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, shallots, and garlic and cook until the mushrooms are browned and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes.\n6. Add the white wine, beef broth, and thyme to the skillet and cook until the liquid has reduced by half, about 5 minutes.\n7. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mushroom mixture cool.\n8. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thickness of 1/4 inch.\n9. Spread the mushroom mixture over the puff pastry.\n10. Place the beef tenderloin on top of the mushroom mixture.\n11. Wrap the puff pastry around the beef tenderloin, making sure to seal the edges.\n12. Brush the beaten egg over the top of the puff pastry.\n13. Place the Beef Wellington on a baking sheet and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the puff pastry is golden brown and the beef tenderloin is cooked to your liking.\n14. Let the Beef Wellington rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.\n\nEnjoy!\n",

            "review": "The base of this game is solid. It's everything I've ever wanted from a Starship Troopers shooter. \n\nThe concept is simple. \"Here's a gun, there's some bugs... Kill 'em all!\"\n\nThe weapons and armor are accurate, the arachnid's look great and most importantly, it's an absolute shitshow from start to finish for each mission. The randomized objectives seem to keep things fresh, though in the long term, I think they'll have to add more, varying objectives to keep the players engaged, but for now, in early access it seems to fit really well. Each mission really feels like the battle scenes from the movies, where troopers are doing their damnedest to hold the line and stay together while giant alien bugs just throw themselves at you and your squad, trying to split everyone up. It's chaos in the best way possible and they've nailed the feel of what it's like to be a rough neck slugging it out on some god forsaken rock in the galactic boondocks.\n\nThe 16-player count on each server does wonders for the experience. Most co-op games cap it at 4 or 8 players if they're feeling frisky, but OWI decided to just go for the glory here and gave us a player-count of 16 Troopers. This may seem like a small thing, but the choice adds a lot of options for people with big groups of friends. On top of it, it adds to the cinematic chaos that is so iconic for the franchise. The game on normal and harder difficulties can really be a struggle at times, and it should be. The movies and lore make even the most basic, Arachnid enemies appear extremely dangerous, and while one or two won't give you much of a problem, if you get mobbed by 10 or more, you'd better be looking for an exit strategy, or hope to god that the cavalry  is coming to save your sorry, ape ass from the shit. But, even if you've planned poorly and your team is too far away, OWI made it fairly easy to get saved by a team member, who can resurrect you, and anyone can do this regardless of what class you choose or what squad you're in. It pushes the concept of teamwork without forcing it as, in my experience, everyone's looking to save someone at any point in time, even at great risk to their own lives. If you are unlucky enough to go down, and perish from your wounds, then you'll have the opportunity to respawn pretty quickly. You'll drop back in close to the action so you can immediately pick up where you left off at killing as many bugs as possible. The only exception to this is once the mission has finished, players must move to the extraction. At this point, respawns are disabled, which seems a little stressful, but as long as you stick with the group, you'll make it out just fine. If you do go down, your teammates can still pick you right back up, too as long as you don't die for realsies.\n\nThe base building is a bit clunky, and a bit unintuitive to start with, but it's simple enough that it's easy to figure out in just a couple of matches, and the construction portions of the missions really add some much needed complexity and variety to the experience. These sequences give players a breather and a chance to heal up, gather some ammo and figure out what role they want to play in the on-coming arachnid assault. Once the assault happens, players will have running around, fixing walls, finishing bunker construction and trying to keep each other alive. The tower defense aspect of the game is definitely a good addition, but I think it needs a few more things to round it out, like constructing manned turrets and traps for the bugs (other than the electrified walls.) It's simple, but it gets the job done for now. If we're talking long term, post-release though, this feature is going to have to be improved in a few ways.\n\nThe only major concern I have with the game so far is the performance. I'm not sure if the game doesn't manage assets right, or if there's a memory leak someplace, but every round I start with 120+fps and by the end of it, I'll be lucky to stay above 40 FPS, even as bugs die and we move away from the constructed base assets, the FPS is just in the gutter. The performance in every single match degrades to a point where I doubt that the game will be playable for people on older rigs. I have a lot of friends that love Starship Troopers as much as I do, but don't have cutting edge hardware. If OWI can't get the performance issues reigned in quickly enough, I think it could hurt the overall experience once it's out of early access and will definitely cause people to not buy, or refund the game if it cannot run smoothly on mid-grade, older hardware.\n\nAll-in-all, OWI has a good thing going withe Extermination so far. It would be cool to see a few other options added to the game as players level up, or even a few more classes. It would be really awesome to have something like a VIP objective, where a player plays a high-ranking official or psychic that has special abilities, but has to be protected from the swarm of baddies all trying to kill them. I'd also like to see a mission where teams can tactically nuke a brain bug, just like in the movies! I do see the current mission objectives becoming stale for players, even with the variable, randomized objectives, but if they continue to add stuff during and after Early Access, I can see this being one of my favorite group games to play with friends for at least the next year or more. Extermination nails what so many games based on films so often get wrong, it makes you feel like a Trooper and from all the people that I've played with yelling movie quotes and Role Playing as a grunt in the trenches, I'm here for all for it. There must be a lot of Starship Troopers fans over in OWI, because they seem to get what makes this experience so special.\n\n",

There need to be bots, difficulty scaling, and alternate game modes (solo, 1-4 player, and even an 8 player mode would be great) for this game to endure.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't say \"no\" to a wider range of guns, attachments, and a system for cosmetic armor pieces (I'd even take color schemes for the basic models).

            "review": "Jumping into a match with a ton of absolute legends screaming out lines from the 1997 Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers has been a dream come true. The first impression really puts you in the Battle of Klendathu, Velaka in this case, with a soundtrack that pays homage to the film. The memorable part of playing will always be the endgame where everyone needs to extract safely and respawning is disabled. Troopers scramble from their overrun makeshift base to the landing zone and do their best to revive or providing covering fire for their fellow comrades. A two minute timer ticks away while an onslaught of Arachnids make their way to the dropship and you see a few Heavy Troopers hunker down with their mobile bunkers and unload their MG's into a wall of bugs. Medics desperately running into the line of fire while praying their drone can revive a downed teammate and Assault Troopers trying their hardest to lay covering fire from above and below. It was chaos on another level and I haven't had this much fun since the modded Left 4 Dead servers that allowed 8v8 with buy options. \n\nThe game is definitely in Alpha stage, with only 2 playable game modes and 3 Classes to level up. Their equipment and weapons are limited but Medic seems to be the most versatile with mid to long range weapons(even a grenade launcher that clears up the field very well), extremely useful perks, and a great selection of grenade types to even the playing field. \n\nThe gunplay is ok, I find myself using the standard issue Morita MK.I rifle way more than anything else for that Starship Trooper Combat Scene feel. It has reliable damage and a decent 60 round clip, but the damage effect on bugs is minimal. You can see some bullet holes on the pinchers of the Arachnids but you don't feel the weight of how much damage you do to them. You also don't see a pile up of bugs while you shoot from a wall to really see the carnage your team is creating when defending. \n\nThere are plenty of bugs to kill and it does not get dull after 8 hours of play. You'll see plenty of Drones and Warrior Bugs, sprinkled with alittle bit of Gunner Bugs who are extremely dangerous if left alone. The real fight happens when a couple Plasma Bugs and Tiger Tank Arachnids appear that can soak up a ton of damage and dish it out to destroy your fortifications. I am hoping the developers add those flying bugs to really make things tense as it is!\n\nI will update this review with Cons in the future because right now I just havent experienced any real issues that have deterred me from playing or requesting a refund.",

            "review": "Enjoyable but flawed. This game fell short of being something incredible.\nI don't believe I'm one of many with this perception of Hogwarts Legacy but it may prove interesting to some nonetheless.\nLong review below:\n\nThe Good:\n+ It's a nice visual game, some parts of it look \"magical\" indeed.\n+ The gameplay works and functions well from start to finish.\n+ The story has a few interesting moments but nothing that will blow you away. There won't be anything you won't see coming.\n+ The spells feel great, combat was one of my favourites aspects of the game. The devs did their job right on this front.\n+ A magical adventure for Harry Potter fans, it IS the best of all Harry Potter games, really immersive in some parts, fun in others and an overall good game. All in all, your money won't be wasted here. There's plenty of content to go around for everyone.\n+ Soundtrack and sound in general is authentic to what the Wizarding world should be.\n\nThe Bad:\nIt's a shame that many RPGs  that are open world learned nothing from Skyrim, Witcher and Red Dead Redemption.\n\n- Everything is so scripted to the point of comedy. As a result of that, it won't take more than several hours to realise how bland and empty Hogwarts is.\nThe best way to describe this is by comparing it to the tv series: Westworld (for those who have seen it). You feel like you're really trying to role play in a fake world.\nThe same animations will play in the castle over and over, the same NPCs with the same lines.\nYou get to experience all yearly seasons but besides some changes in the castle and around it, the NPCs react to nothing. Their garbs won't change according to the weather - in fact, they're not even reacting to it.\n\n- Immersion breaking.\nWhen you go outside of the castle in summer, you'll spot two students playing a game. That's a very nice moment to see the NPCs have activities around the castle. However, you'll reach winter and the same students are playing the same game, in their same outfits outside in the courtyard even at night time. The same orchestra music that you first hear when you go across the hall will be playing throughout all seasons, through all day/night cycles. It goes from a wondrous, special moment to a tedious, run faster so it'll bother you less.\nFor an RPG, one of its priorities should be to establish or at least try to make something remotely natural for the NPCs to do. There's many more such situations but I won't go further into that.\n\n- Progression is tied to the main story.  You cannot interact with your dorm colleagues or anyone around the castle unless it's a quest or a silly side quest. The house you pick doesn't matter. You'll only get 1 quest per house and it'll vary the looks of your outfit. I chose Ravenclaw but was shown around by a Weasly. I was expecting to have someone from my own dorm to be my friend/guide to lead me through the castle. \n\n- Your choices in the game have no consequence. Cast incendio wherever you want because nobody will react to it.\n\n- I understand that the developers are trying so hard to be \"progressive\" but in their pursuit of fulfilling an agenda they made the setting of 1800s Scotland feel like 2023 woke Hollywood. You'll hear the name of \"Sirona\" and how special she is more times than you'll enter her tavern.\n\n- Enemies around the world: \nYou'd expect the \"Forbidden forest\" and \"any other place in the world\" to be somewhat different from each other since it's an RPG.\nThe enemies around the castle would be of a lower level while the forbidden forest would have tougher or more dangerous enemies. That's not the case.\nYou'll fight: humans, spiders, frogs, wolves, trolls, goblins and That's it. There won't be a special enemy type anywhere in this world.\n\n- No interesting side quests or random events. Hogwarts Legacy doesn't have a natural side quest in it. You're exploring and suddenly you come across something - well, kinda... Some merchant who needs his pet rescued or kill more poachers. That's all you'll get.\nThe motivation to do these menial side missions is even lower due to the interchangeably awful voice acting and writing. It feels like if it’s not the writing that’s off, it’s the acting and vice versa. I would say the acting isn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but the writing reaches lower echelon Bethesda more often than not.\n\n- The HUD is cluttered and breaks immersion.\n- No memorable characters besides Sebastian.\n- No matter the graphical settings, the game has issues around Hogwarts and especially Hogsmead. Lots of stuttering, textures loading in late, so on and so forth. It's got technical issues still as of June 2023.\n\nConclusion:\nDespite most of its flaws and shortcomings Hogwarts Legacy is a strong game that many people will grow fond of. \nIt does the main part right: gameplay, decent story, graphics and depicts the world of Harry Potter better than other harry potter games.\nI strongly believe it wouldn't have been as successful if it weren't for huge controversies or if it didn't have the Harry Potter theme around it.\n\nIt's a 7.8 / 10",

This is the first computer game I have ever played - because I am a potter fan. And WOW! I now have so much respect for people who work in the gaming industry. It takes so much attention to detail and professionalism to create a quality game like this. What is amazing about this game is there are so many different ways to play it - you can find whatever works for you. If you like combat - go fight some trolls. If you like treasure hunt - go explore the school grounds and the forbidden forest. If you like raising pets - go catch some fantastic beasts. If you like the story - just stand in the middle of the hallway and listen to student gossip. this game caters to EVERYONE. i love it. My only complaint would be if this game could be played with multiple players. e.g. I invite my friends to hang out at the library together - that would be awesome!!! This game is beautifully made. Good job to the gaming team who created this.",

That statement alone might suffice as a review in itself, but I'm not one to keep things that brief, so let me delve deeper and elaborate.\n\nThe developers promised us a game in which we can explore a rich open world comprised of Hogwarts and its surroundings, stories and places that may not be actual Harry Potter canon, but they're about as close as it gets. They succeeded beautifully, managing to avoid the blatant kind of fan service bordering on distasteful. It would have been all too easy to land in that pitfall and create a story with an old, wise and mysterious Headmaster, a grumpy and unlikeable Potions teacher who turns out to be a good guy, a half-giant teaching Beasts class, etc., but the teachers you will meet here all feel original, their job the only thing they share with their modern-age successors. The world feels refreshingly unique and comfortably familiar at the same time. The aspects that resonate are those tied to Hogwarts' rich history, recreated with loving care - notable locations, houses, ghosts, portraits, and the like. But it stops there. You won't be bumping into a kid Dumbledore in this game, and that's a plus in my book.\n\nExploration in Hogwarts Legacy should be pure bliss through and through for any Harry Potter fan, from Hogwarts to Hogsmeade and the Highlands. Puzzles are also entertaining, although I had a frustrating experience when one of them bugged out and became unsolvable until I finally realized that and restarted the quest. Combat feels dynamic and fun despite being on the easy side - this was probably a deliberate choice to accommodate younger players as well as HP fans who may not be hardcore gamers. (That being said, the final boss fight is challenging, so you'll want to gear up before going there.) I recommend playing with a controller, as 16 combat spells can be easily assigned and used quickly with a little practice. They all have their specific merits but come with a hefty cooldown time, so as a result, you'll light up the battlefield with a nice variation of spells just like a real wizard would instead of spamming the same move over and over again, as it often happens in similar games that use a mana-based system. (I can't say how grateful I am to the developers for avoiding the concept of mana entirely, as it wouldn't fit in well with the HP canon.) After spending over 70 hours in the game, fights still feel epic and satisfying to me, despite being aware that there is no way I might lose. An extra difficulty level over Hard would be appreciated, perhaps in a future update.\n\nOn another positive note, the game is very kid-friendly. My five-year-old daughter frequently awaits her turn to take the controller and ride a mount or interact with the cute animals. My sons are a bit older, and they can play the whole game on their own.\n\nAll that being said, some people are apparently less than thrilled with the game, and I think I can understand their perspective. While walking the corridors of Hogwarts, students often chit-chat but there are no interactions with your character. On occasion, unique events unfold which are usually solved by a figure of authority, but the player is left without any role to play. It's more akin to watching a movie scene than being an active participant. These events could have been done differently to allow the main character to make a choice that could impact the outcome of the event and the future status of the same minor NPCs, much like we see in other RPGs.\n\nNow, on to the primary point of criticism: the story. The central plot is passable and the side quests thankfully involve some narrative unlike the \"kill/bring a number of whatevers\" type of quests often seen in other games when the writers run out of ideas. That alone is commendable given the sheer number of side quests. None of the characters come across as one-dimensional and each appears to carry a certain depth, but sadly, that depth often goes unexplored due to the storylines' simplicity.  There is no romance in the game (which I don't consider a drawback, as I always opt for romance-free playthroughs myself). Narrative-wise, you won't find anything here that lives up to the standards of the original Harry Potter books, but that was to be expected. Sebastian's side story stands out as both the darkest and the best one of them all, and was the only one that genuinely made me ponder over my choices. While it doesn't reach J. K. Rowling's heights, it does possess the quality of an above-average HP fan fiction. My only complaint is something I cannot explain without a spoiler (skip ahead to the last paragraph if you want to avoid it). There is a scene in which Sebastian suggests you use your unique ability to help his sister by removing her sense of pain. At this point in the story, the consequences are not known. This should have been explored further, giving you the chance to decide whether to do so, risking either the consequences or Sebastian's anger.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of Harry Potter, there is a high chance you'll appreciate Hogwarts Legacy. However, your enjoyment will also hinge on why you loved the HP books in the first place. If the plot twists and relatable character interactions were the only aspects you liked, you may find the game somewhat underwhelming. But if, like me, you were captivated by the intricate world-building and eagerly pieced together the functioning of the wizarding world from the clues the books provided - keeping tabs on spells, creatures, places, potions, historical events, etc. - then this game is definitely for you. Go on, fulfill your long-held dream and have a taste of student life at Hogwarts!",

But then you realize that there is almost zero role-play involved in this game - it's just going out and killing stuff. You can cast Unforgivable Curses at will in front of your peers and professors and nobody bats an eye. Having finished the main quest and a few side quests, I don't see any replay value or ever coming back to this game, so I guess I will have to play through Skyrim for the 26th time. Hopefully the sequels or related games will have the same world details, but actually make it so that your actions have consequences or the story remotely interesting.",

            "review": "[h1]If Spore grew up into a shallow, space-themed, open-world sandbox, with MMO-like grind[/h1]\n\nIf you have had the pleasure of playing Maxis' 2008 hit game, Spore - this game is the spiritual successor. Everything from trying to fly your spaceship to the center of the galaxy, exploring randomly generated worlds and ecosystems, to the casual combat feel. \n\n[u]The problem is, the universe of No Man's Sky is very shallow and repetitive, inspite of all its procedurally generation.[/u] What I mean by that, is that while the core gameplay loop (explore -> gather -> upgrade -> repeat) can be very enjoyable, [u]there is a lack of depth and variety in the gameplay.[/u]\n\nIf you are planning to get into this game, I hope you will go in with the expectations of a janky indy-project, more than a AAA blockbuster title or anything.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]Lack of Depth[/h1]\n\nLike Spore in the space stage, the gameplay is straightforward. First, you will learn how to survive in the environment, gathering resources to fix your spacesuit and tool. Then you are left to learn about the different ways of gathering resource / making money / fighting different enemies... and that's all there is to the game.\n\nDifferent worlds will have different hazards (cold/heat/radiation/acid/water) but these provides almost no difference in gameplay. You just get a different colored damage bar that you will have to refill with the same resource occasionally... Even the most basic of gameplay change, like having your laser gun overheat at different speed depending on the planet temperature, is not part of this game. Every planet also have the same gravity, every planet is a terrestrial world (no gas giants!?) and there is no exploration off-planets.\n\nYou will need to gather a variety of resources and recipes to make your life easier; but in the end, all you get is just a bigger number. No gameplay change, no interesting tradeoff in upgrades, just, finding gears with bigger number and more slots.\n\nThe alien interactions are also lacking. Though NMS tried to build a sense of mystery by having you learn the languages (literally word-by-word!), it is functionally meaningless. You can still trade and get along just fine without learning a single word.\nWhile some encounters may prompt you to read in the alien's language, getting the answer right provides meager rewards in the long run. You can get along just fine without them, and getting those rewards only help you minimally, mostly in the early game.\n\n[h1]Lack of Variety[/h1]\n\nThe game is extremely repetitive. You will see it, even on your first planet. \n\nEach world is just red/green/blue hills. The \"hazards\" are just different colored damage bars. Acid is green, heat is red, cold is blue, and radiation is yellow. All planets have the same gravity, just different size. No gas giants or any other interesting celestial bodies to explore. You can't even get out of your ship off-planet (and outside of space stations). Like, what do you mean I can't go and explore the asteroid belts? What do you mean I can't even fly into the sun if I wanted to!? \n\nThe different \"encounters\" are repeatedly copy-pasted over and over. Cargo drops? You'll find them everywhere. Crashed ship? Same shape, same cargo, same gameplay. Artifact digs? I hope you liked the toy where you dig dinosaur bones out of clay, because this is literally all you do. Not even the positions in each encounters are randomized. It's just land, go to the same location, do the same thing, lift off, and repeat.\n\nThe missions are also just cheaply randomized go here, do this, shoot that. Alien relationship means nothing, and you just spam \"learn dialect\" to get yet another word then walk away. Even Spore Galactic Adventures, a game from 2009, had more gameplay variety than this game.\n\nWhich brings me to the next issue...\n\n[h1]The Grind[/h1]\n\nThis game becomes all about grind. Go shoot that tree to get this resource, fly there and get that upgrade, repeatedly do capitalist things until you have enough money to buy a frigate that can carry all your stuff. Then go to the center of the galaxy I guess.\n\nI'm already sinking almost 40 hours into this game, and I've been repeatedly doing the same thing over and over and over... And I really want to recommend this game, but I just can't.\n\n[h1]The Jank[/h1]\n\nAnd to wrap all this up nicely, the game is very \"jank\".\n\n[u]The keyboard and mouse control scheme is probably the worst I have ever seen.[/u] It is very clear that this game was designed for controller first, and the keyboard and mouse controls were added later by someone who has never played on a PC. From the moment I booted up the game and got greeted with a \"hold left mouse to press button\", I knew I was in for a ride. Somehow, NMS devs has managed to make a control scheme that requires too many buttons, and also too deeply nested within its own submenus. I learnt the controls within about a day of playing, but the learning phase was absolutely infuriating.\n\nThe game is still also very buggy, [u]TEN YEARS[/u] after the game's 2013 VGX premiere. You will find generated cargo drops and plants floating / clipping into each other. The way procedural generation works is also very jank, as you will constantly find mountains and buildings fade in-out of existence while you are flying over a planet. Oh, and did I mention that your game will crash if you try to use its built-in screenshot function? Yeah, that's [i]still[/i] a thing.\n\n[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]\n\n> I love all the base-builder/sandbox games from Sim City to Minecraft, where I enjoy doing whatever the hell I pleased, without needing \"objectives\" to do. But No Man's Sky just doesn't have as much depth as those games.\n\n> I love all the grindy JRPGs where I repeatedly hit different colored slime with my bigger number sticks, where I eventually get to watch the story unfold. But No Man's Sky doesn't have as compelling a narrative like those games either.\n\n> I loved the original Spore for its carefree exploration of the universe. But No Man's Sky delivers that with jank lipservice, failing to provide anything actually interesting to explore or see, and in a completely unimmersive way.\n\nI myself am a complete sucker for this type of games, and I really wanted to love and recommend No Man's Sky, but I just can't. I'll probably grind it just for completion, but nothing more. Spore did it better.",

I finally dove in a few months ago just to see if I would enjoy it. This is THE space survival game, no other game even comes close. If you're into survival games that is this is an absolute treasure. Not to mention the fact that they haven't done the whole Paradox thing and released 50 DLC at this point, all content has been free.\n\nMy ONE complaint, and it's probably just because I haven't spent enough time in the game. Is the whole \"Expedition\" mechanic. If you're familiar with Seasons from other big MMOs it's of the similar vein. I'm just not sure if \"I\" find them fun, doesn't mean that you wont of course.\n\nAs far as price goes, 60$ is a pretty steep cost. I personally try to buy everything on sale and rarely buy games at full price. The amount of content in this game though is easily more than your average two AAA combined, maybe even three.",

Trust no one.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/meetothers.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Survive Chernarus</h2><br>The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/survive+navigation_v2.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Loot Up</h2><br>Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well-placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/contaminated.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take your Shot</h2><br>Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart-pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/takeyourshotv2.gif?t=1674143992\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Install Mods</h2><br>Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like-minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan-made features, maps, and guns – all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/221100/extras/basebuilding+crafting.gif?t=1674143992\" />",

Gunshots don't register, suppressed shots pull every zombie with a 20 km radius. Zombie path finding is absurd, you run through the woods, through 15 buildings across a river and over a mountain and the zombie chasing you is on your ass and not even broken a sweat. Loot spawn sucks. You get hungry / die of starvation way too quickly. Trying to constantly repair your gear sucks. Weapons break after 5 swings/shots. Sickness sucks, in the \"cold\" for 2 seconds? Fatally ill. The new sprain/broken leg system sucks, get hit by one zombie? Broken leg, wince and blurred screen with every step. Oh and good f**king luck finding a vehicle.\n\nGame is just laborious.  After all this time they've made it prettier, it gets good frame rates. But what does it matter when the core game is still ass.",

There's very little fun about finding an item only for it to break and be useless after fighting 3 zombies or opening 2 cans of food. 2/10 and that feels generous.",

First time you will be domed by a player over a nice looking shirt, the second time you will get mauled by one or several zombies, the second time you will find food, then shit yourself to death because of cholera or salmonella, etc. \n\nThe game focuses alot on a kind of realism that can be alot of fun. Be prepared to use a mic in this game because players will kill you if you dont speak, typing isnt good enough. You can play all the way from an easy, +loot game, or a game where it rains constantly, theres almost no loot, and you will have to stop every 500 meters to light a fire and wring out your clothes and let them dry before you go on. Some servers let you build tents, bases, get vehicles etcetera. This game is a walking simulator on some maps, but other community maps are smaller and allows for a lot more player engagement. This game is full of stories, both good and bad, some hilarious.\n\nI knew about this game since like, 2015 or so, but JSchlatt really made me want to play this game. THis game is hard as nails, it takes alot to figure it out, im still a big fat noob at 40 hours and i usually die before i manage to get inland, especially on populated servers where all the coasts and first towns are looted completely, since people respawn more often than they stay alive. It can be a tiresome game, i get headaches from the grass texture after a few hours of playing, i dont have anyone to play this game with, so i play solo. I reccommend this game with friends, or find a group you can play with, preferably a friend or two.",

            "review": "Okayish gameplay bogged down by too many issues to count. The biggest being whether the game even works, as it feels like it is constantly taken offline every other day for impromptu maintenance.\n\nThere is an impressive amount of mobile suits from basically every Gundam series on tap, and this has been monetized to the max with gacha mechanics and loot boxes. You are given free currency and some free suits as a new player, but you will quickly learn who the paypigs are once you drop into a handful of quick matches.\n\nAlso, true to scammy gacha fashion, all suits have an arbitrary \"rarity\" denoted by its stars so even if you own the same suit as someone, their suit will have arbitrarily higher stats due to having more stars. Combat is filled with stunlocking and melee scrubbery,  as the optimal strategy is to simply chain-stagger an enemy with powerful weapons until you can finish them off easily.\n\nAll the animations are infuriatingly slow and it takes your suit about 20 seconds to get up when knocked on its ass. The customization and some of the shooting gameplay can be fun, there's just too much else negative for me to recommend it.\n\nIt's free so try it if you want, you might have fun until you get dropped in a lobby filled with paypigs piloting gold-plated Gundams.",

Real nice of you, real nice. \n\nAlso might not recommend this game if you're allergic to spending money on gacha games.\n\nthe 20% of the time that the game works as intended it is everything I loved about GBO2 on the PS4 I just Cannot recommend it in its current state.\n\nGameplay:\n8/10\nPerhaps a little slow, but once you learn the ebb and flow of combat its a really nice Gundam game.\n\nPerformance:\n1/10\nMatchmaking is broken, matches tend to lock up and it boots you out of matchmaking 60% of the time.\n\nNetwork:\n7/10\nLaggy, manageable, but laggy.\n\n",

This game is too short. I mean for almost the same price as Marvel's Spiderman, I finished all objectives in well around 26 hrs as compared to the 100+ hrs it took me for Spiderman.\n2. There needs to be some varieties of enemies and bosses. I feel like I only remember Prowler, Rhino and Tinkerer fights, but then again the first point kinda covers it.\n3. The venom and cloaking are awesomely done in this game, loved those abilities.\n4. Costumes are downright sick, better than the Spiderman ones' imo.\n5. Ran really well on Steam Deck (finished it on deck).\n\nIf this game had the same or almost similar amount of gameplay content as Spiderman, this would have been my favorite spiderman game yet.\n\nIac, this game is worth playing, maybe get it on sale coz original price ain't worth it.\n\n",

The movement mechanics and the finishers in the game scream \"Next Level\". surely an enjoyable game has some amazing tracks in it if you wanna vibe but the puzzles don't seem to be a challenge at all and very few boss fights and not that difficult. A very good game considering how  small it is.\n\nMy score : 7.6/10",

Such a great game and the story was amazing just like the OGs Spider-Man. Insomniac Games, pls keep on making great quality single player games and don't end up like the other game developers who became greedy and just care about money. Don't end up making multiplayer games or do not get the idea of it, cause your gonna get greedy too like the rest of the game developers. Pls make games like these and i count on you for making marvel games. Right now i can't wait for the Wolverine and Spider-Man 2 game getting ported into PC.",

            "review": "Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a more condensed and standalone experience of 2018’s mainline Sony’s Spider-Man.\n\nThe game is quite short, clocking at around 10-12 hours if you focus on the main story. I personally find this a negative for the game, letting the plot cook and gameplay progression requiring investment a bit more could’ve made this a more memorable experience.\n\nDespite that, I still think this is a very good videogame and should be what a AAA game offers, a competently-made product that is fun, paced out well, and utilizes the production value to tell stories and experiences in the best way possible. Insomniac’s Spider-Man series managed to put every part of what they wanted the game to be into very good places, which can be a rare sight for big games these days.\nIf you’ve already played 2018’s Spider-Man, you should have a very good idea of what this game is by now. But for those who don’t, I recommend playing and completing the first game before playing Miles Morales.\n\nThe open world genre for Spider-Man is simply perfect. With our hero’s agility and web slinging power, it is only right for the virtual playground to be as free and open as possible. The implementation of this genre can go in many different ways, but Insomniac has done it right. New York is the perfect fit for Spider-Man’s movement. The abundant buildings and narrow streets are great for traversing with slings and parkour techniques, but Spider-Man can also swing a little higher and jump from rooftop to rooftop as well. Mile Morales’s version of New York  also offers a new coat of paint by it being in the Christmas season. Snow covered streets and brick buildings make the city feel nostalgic yet unpredictable. People on the sidewalks are talking to one another and commenting on Spider-man swinging by. Car drivers beep their horns and shout mean words to one another. Meanwhile, some rooftops host barbeque parties and have people hanging about, calmed from the chaotic world below. This depiction of New York is so true to life, and only rivaled by the likes of Ubisoft’s The Division and GTA IV’s similar Liberty City.\n\nScattered around the city are collectables and side activities that are colored brightly on the map. The number of distractions are moderated very well, and I never felt overwhelmed or bored going after these side content for completion. It would take only around 3-4 hours to go around and collect everything, which is fitting for how short the main story is. Aside from the pre-placed game elements, there are also randomly spawned Crimes that you can partake in. These serve as random mini combat encounters and a way to earn XP. These pop up once every 20-40 seconds when you travel through the city, which doesn’t make it too annoying and keeps the open world alive.\n\nWhat impresses me a lot about Insomniac Spider-Man is how great the combat system is. From stealth to combat, it just feels so right. The focus on Spidey’s agility and aggressiveness in combat not only make the game engaging, but also super cinematic as well. Miles has the ability to use his bioelectric power to damage multiple enemies or lower their defenses, which flow very with the standard fighting rhythm introduced in 2018’s. Another thing that also pleasantly surprises me is how seriously Insomniac takes New Game + mode. From the get-go, in the upgrades menu, there are already teases of what is unlockable in New Game +, almost like they are luring you to beat this game and then come back for even more. I love this design decision and would like to see more games toy with player’s excitement like this.\n\nTo combat the player's increase in power, the enemies in Miles Morales pack some serious punches. Early on in the game, there are still standard enemies with bare fists and guns. But later on, they can block your attacks, prevent you from using powers, or be immune to certain moves entirely. This creates the dynamic of you constantly recognizing which enemy you are fighting and how to deal with each one. But this isn’t Rock, Paper, Scissors, most enemies can still be beaten by a string of normal punches and kicks, but the ways the game throws these enemies at you make you want to utilize everything that you have, in order to dispatch these foes fast and as stylish as possible.\n\nThe Story of Mile Morales is the main thing I think could be better. Due to the game's runtime, you get so little time to bond over the characters involved with Miles. They are likable and have each of their own moments to shine, but they are not complex. Complexity in friends and family can really improve a Spider-Man’s plot, in my opinion, it being mostly a coming-of-age story and all that. This game is more short and sweet, like a spin-off movie, rather than it trying to tell a comprehensive development of Miles himself, which isn’t wrong, I just wish it was different.\n\nWith everything mentioned, I think this game is a very nice package that you can boot up and instantly have a great time. It’s nice and short, but not the greatest. 7/10 a really solid buy, but not a must-play. I personally recommend it on bigger sale.\n",

            "review": "Rarely do i write reviews, but some wrong info in these reviews makes me feel obligated to.\n\nFriends Vs Friends is a 1v1 or 2v2 Fast Paced Deck Building FPS. Think Furry Quake if your opponent can activate vampire poison bullets on a katana while moving 40% faster. You buy packs with in game currency to get new cards and upgrade your current ones, and some of these get quite unique. Head exposure reveals an enemy brain above the rivals head for 4 seconds that amps damage 10x, which can be countered by cards like tin man that turns you and your ally invincible for temporarily while slowing you. It's a really interesting system that opens the door for many different playstyles and decks.\n\nThe maps are all fun despite there only being 4 of them right now, each giving a different range of engagement and lending itself to certain decks and characters better than others. Trucks is a compact map with moving parts and deadly falls into the road that makes movement speed and close range more important than trying to keep distance, where rooftops is 2 roofs that make both long range play and rush strats viable. The characters are much the same way, each giving a massive influence over how you build your deck, such as explosive resistance, starting with a Brasshopper smg, double jumps, ect.\n\nTo clear up misinfo, no you cannot buy cards with real money. There are no microtransactions in this game. The deluxe edition gives no card packs, just access to upcoming expansions.\n\nYes, you can 2v2 with a friend against random. Just open your ui menu, and there's an invite button on the top right. When they join, hit 2v2. You are now playing Friends Vs Friends with your friends.\n\nSome actual issues with the game right now is the progression, but as of right now they came out with a patch that \"fixes\" progression that I have not played. An issue that is here is explosives clipping your camera into the floor or walls from the flinch. This happens to enemies too, particularly to moose for some reason, making it really disorienting when a bomb goes off. I've heard of it happening with being hit by a sniper but I haven't had this.\n\nAll in all, wonderful game. If you have friends, queue up 2v2 and work together with your decks and you'll curb stomp in no time.\n\n",

            "review": "Look I can tell a lot of love went into this game and it has a great original idea but honestly it just doesn't work. I give it a lot of credit for not being pay to win and having a lot of personality but game play wise a lot of stuff needs to be fixed or outright scrapped to save this games life.\n\n First off and this is the most important point is that its entirely hostile to new players and its not even an issue of skill here, the problem lies in the cards leveling system. New players get base cards with no levels putting them at a huge disadvantage against the sweats and veteran players which will kill your player base post launch. This is the same issue battlefront had with its cards because its a no fun zone for people just trying to get ahead of the curve. \n\nSecond is the leveling and how its a grind to get new character unlocks. Getting tokens and card packs is a major grind and takes forever to get a hold of. At level 10 with 7 hours so far I have bought like 3 gold card packs. I mean there's nothing else to spend your money on and since the game just started I understand, just hoping its temporary until the game gets more content. Also that weird gumball machine thing for cosmetics, like getting tokens for that is near impossible since you need 3 and only get like 1 token for completing daily tasks that are a whole other grind fest for new players. \n\nThe characters are cool and unique but giving them special cards that are just like free op weapons isnt a good idea. I think that the characters who get free weapons at the start should either have a nerfed version of the gun or just scarp giving people weapons unless its in a card. Like use Duck Anderson as a model for this because Im tired of these guys who get to start off with smgs and katanas who build decks based around getting up in your face and having do defense against them. Like close quarters guns dominate this game and I would like to see some balance changes in the future.\n\nTLDR: Game is pretty but game play needs a heavy overhaul. New players get no love. Hope to see major changes.",

            "review": "[h1] An incredible Gem with Devs Who Listen [/h1]\n\nNot a day after the game is out and complaints heard by amazing devs have seen the progression system generously tweaked. A patch this morning at lightning speed took the progression from glacial to reasonable in one fell swoop. This feels like a much better place for the game and I'm much happier with how it is to get cards and xp now. That being my biggest complaint there really isn't a reason to ignore this one if you're at all looking for a quirky shooter that has been carefully crafted with love. I'd still like to see quests at least tweaked to \"play\" based objectives instead of win. As to the developers comment about friends helping friends complete quests. Personally I don't see such a problem with that. Daily quests get us to log in. If the game is fun enough we'll play anyway (and this one certainly is). \n\nIn addition to the very helpful changes to xp and cash gain they even added level based matchmaking that tries to match you near your current player level. It's not MMR but absolutely fixes the issue I had with some players already using level 4 versions of cards. \n\nThe remaining complaints are minor enough and if this first patch is anything to go off of will likely be fixed and probably are already seen. I still think the cosmetic coins are stingy and would still think they were a bit stingy if we got 1 every game. Quests should absolutely be available sooner than level 8 and need that switch from \"win\" to \"play\" but these are minor problems.\n\nThis game is incredibly generous. My previous bellyaching was really an ache for a game with so much promise and joy to give me a yet smoother experience. The truth is for the cost of a cheap lunch I've already spent hours laughing and smiling with my friends and that's absolutely worth it. This game is a gift and the price is a steal and if you're at all on the edge here please let me push you over it and while you're diving in, grab your friends too.\n\nNow if only there were some mini games to play in this diner.\n\n[b](OLD REVIEW LEFT BELOW FOR COMPARISON)[/b]\n\nThis game has charm, it's got ritz, the guns sound right, the music is lovely, the animation when you open the game is exciting, catchy and fun! They even have a hub to mess around in while you wait to find a match. Interesting level design, Unique core concept and what is probably one of the worst progression systems I've seen in a non free to play game. Mind you there are no microtransactions but honestly I've seen games that squeeze you for gold or gems that are more generous.\n\nAfter 8 hours of play I managed a total of 10 levels and half of them didn't get me anything. Packs cost way too much and your xp and cash you gain takes forever. Quests usually want you to win and you don't even get them until level 8. When you do get quests they ask you to do absurdly long tasks. \"win 8 1v1 games\" w h a t?! With the average win rate being 50% that's like asking me to play 16 games. Except its not because theres no MMR so if you struggle with the game at all you'll never be completing these quests. Go on a losing streak? Get ready to feel it. Worst of all about the current quest system is that [b] in a game literally titled \"Friends vs Friends\" you cannot complete quests against your friends. You are punished for fighting your friends.[/b]\n\nCosmetics are in this game and accessable with in game earned currency. That's kinda cool! Except to get them you need to do ALL 3 of your daily quests and that gets you 1 token of 3 that you need to put into a literal gacha machine to get a chance for 1 cosmetic. Did you get a bad one? Don't worry after another 24 actual hours of gameplay you might have your next one. Here's hoping you get something besides a profile picture for the following roll!\n\nThis would all be fine but the guy who's been playing since the beta has a lv 4 gun and 3 cards you've never seen before and will absolutely delete you the second you walk out with your \"big head mode\" card you just played. This is a masterful and amazingly well made game that's so close to where I want it to be. I'll change this review when I see an update made to address the absolutely painful progression.\n\nThe developers claim they'll change this soon. When they do I'll change this review.",

But we are looking for options because i feel similar to you about this,\n\nThanks for the feedback! <3"

FIFA 23 is a disgrace to the gaming community and a tragic waste of your time, money, and sanity.\n\nAs a long-time fan of football and video games, I never thought I'd see the day when I would be forced to write such a scathing review. But here we are, with FIFA 23, a game that has not only failed to live up to its predecessors, but has also managed to become an unmitigated disaster in every sense of the word.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how bad FIFA 23 is. Imagine a steaming pile of garbage on your doorstep, and you're getting close. This game is so deplorable, it's almost an insult to refer to it as a \"game.\" It's more like a cruel prank, a travesty that shakes the very foundations of the gaming world.\n\nSickening Gameplay\nIf you thought the gameplay in previous FIFA titles was smooth and enjoyable, prepare to be bitterly disappointed. FIFA 23 has taken all the elements that made its predecessors great and thrown them out the window. The controls are clunky, unresponsive, and frustrating. It's as if the developers coded the game with their eyes closed and their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nDisgraceful Graphics\nDespite having access to next-gen technology, FIFA 23 looks like it was made in the late '90s. The graphics are so abysmal that it's difficult to tell which pixelated blob is supposed to represent your favorite footballer. The stadiums, the crowd, and even the grass on the pitch – everything is an eyesore.\n\nUnforgivable In-Game Purchases\nFIFA 23 has taken microtransactions to an entirely new level of greed. It's as if EA Sports wants to suck every last cent out of your pocket. The game is so heavily designed around in-game purchases that it's virtually impossible to progress or enjoy the experience without shelling out an exorbitant amount of money.\n\nA Laughable Career Mode\nThe career mode in FIFA 23 is an absolute joke. It's as if the developers put no thought or effort into creating a compelling and immersive experience. Instead, they've given us a shallow, uninteresting, and downright boring mode that will make you question why you even bothered to turn on your console.\n\nTo Sum It Up\nFIFA 23 is, without a doubt, the worst game ever created. It's an affront to the gaming community and a disgrace to the FIFA franchise. If you value your time, money, and sanity, stay far away from this abomination.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid FIFA 23 at all costs. This is not a game. It's a nightmare.",

Do not waste your money, I refunded as soon as possible without playing a minute of gameplay because the game runs an anticheat before it starts but the anticheat freezes and crashes constantly. Do some research and have a look at the multitude of videos from other customers of the game with the same issue. You have to go into your computer files and fuck around with uninstalling and reinstalling files, and removing anticheats for other games because FIFAs anticheat likes to be the only one. \n\nIt is a toxic relationship where it wants you to want it but it wants to have whoever else without you being shitty. Get out while you can and date someone sweeter, might I suggest Sex With Hitler? It's a lot more fun than this shite.",

Don't get caught up over losing loot to dying to a zombie bite or drinking bleach accidentally, it's just part of the game. Let your kid choose where you spawn, or where to loot, or even letting him drive and just have fun stabbing and running from zeds for an evening. I focus on looting supplies to keep us alive, he works the combat and is an excellent fighter.\n\nAn awesome game to bond over, and a great way to talk about how to survive a zombie apocalypse, how to deal with disappointment, how to work as a team when deciding who keeps the best loot, and how to never give up, He loves to kill zeds, will upend a planned looting trip to help some zombie get his head bashed in with a frying pan. Great game to play with your kids.",

            "review": "I woke up in my small house in the town called Riverside, The TV was on talking about a \"Knox Event\" or whatever. I went outside to check what was going on and low and behold. My neighbor was feasting on his wife or whoever she was. I quickly ran inside to grab the nearest weapon i had, but i only had a few cooking utensils and some books. I picked up a frying pan i had put in a cabinet and ventured out through by backdoor. My yard wasnt really that big, a dozen of people i had never seen before was roaming around the yard groaning and yelling, i run inside again and decide it might be a better idea to go out the frontdoor instead.\n\n My neighbor was still eating on a now unregonsiseable corpse. He notices me and groans at me, slowly getting on his feet he and stumbling closer and closer to me. I take out the frying pan and when he got close enough to me i bashed him on his head. He made a sound and fell to the ground, he wasnt dead yet, but just writhing in pain on the ground. Even though it should had given him atleast some brain damage, he got up again and attacked me again, without any luck of course. I hit him a few more times, and at last he stops breathing and making noises. I take no time to think what had just happend, because behind me, 3 or more shamblers had heard all the commotion and were now walking towards me. Me and my frying pan were no match for all of these folk, so i run across the street were my neighboor had a car parked, i jump inside the car hoping the car was still intact, but of couse it wasnt. The shamblers were getting closer to the car i was sitting in and i quickly jumped out and ran into the house the car was parked infront of. The owner was home, only he was quite dead. A woman stood at the window banging on it while groaing. I sneak up behind her, and bang her on the head, she -like the other one- falls to the ground. And instead of waiting for her to get up, i bash her brains in with my trusty frying pan. The other shamblers were now at the front door, banging on it.\n\nI quickly ran out of the back door and went around the corner but what i hadnt noticed was that 2 shamblers had for some unknown reason decided to stand right there, i couldnt manage to stop sprinting, so i plow through them. Bad decision. I fall to the ground with a scraped knee and the other shambler couldnt resist and she took a bite out of my shoulder.\n Panic hit me, and i ran onto the main street and took my socks off and ripped them so i could use them as makeshift bandage. The comics i had read a long time ago talked about if you were bitten by the undead -which i assumed these shamblers were- you were destined to die and become one of them. Across the street i saw a pharmacy, and thought \"I got nothing to lose now, might aswell check for something to cure me or atleast take the pain away\"\n\nI run to the main entrance, but the door is closed. So i took out my frying pan and busted the windows open. I had forgot the glass shards and so i cut myself when going through the window. My right arm was completly ripped open. I checked the shelves for some disinfectant but there werent any. But i did find some painkillers, i chuck down a pack or 2 of painkillers and decided to hide in the backrooms of the building, i was still bleeding profusely and i heard all of the undead enter the building. This was the end. Not even a day in and i was already going to die. The shamblers were now at the door to the room i was in, bashing and hitting the door, eager to get to me so they could feast on my tasty flesh. They kick down the door and make their way towards me, i hit as many as i can, but there were too many. One of them bites my leg and i get thrown to the floor, they were all over me now, biting and scrathing all of my limbs, the pain was immesurabel i was screaming and crying. They were literally tearing me apart. Until i couldnt handle it anymore, and passed away not so peacefully and turned into one of them. \n\nThat's basically how my first game of project zomboid went. Chaotic, Dramatic and funny as hell. You've heard it before but i'll say it again.\n\n BEST. SURVIVAL. GAME. TO. DATE.",

Despite its simple appearance, the gameplay is rich, presenting new challenges and opportunities to learn. The modding scene is incredibly vast, further expanding the game's potential.\n\nEvery time I dive into the game, I'm faced with numerous challenges. From managing the food situation to finding suitable shelter and arranging transportation, it consistently engages me. It pushes me to think strategically, weighing the benefits of stealth versus the risks of being loud. This is the essence of what survival games should strive for, creating addictive and thoroughly enjoyable experiences.\n\nWhat sets Project Zomboid apart are the small yet significant details that enhance the overall enjoyment. For instance, the logical aspect of breaking a window becomes immersive when clearing out the glass before jumping over, reducing the risk of injury.\n\nMoreover, the game's modding scene is truly incredible. Even without mods, you can immerse yourself for days on end. However, with the vast array of mods available, the gameplay can extend for months, showcasing the game's amazing potential. The supportive community adds to the awesomeness of the overall experience, fostering a sense of camaraderie and creativity among players.\n\nIn summary, Project Zomboid delivers an exceptional survival game with a rich gameplay experience, abundant challenges, and ample opportunities to learn. The modding scene expands its replayability, while the community adds to the overall enjoyment. It's a must-play for fans of the genre.",

No more power - enjoy that electronic furniture.\n\nNo more food restocks.   No fresh razors, nothing.  What's left - is all there is to it.\n\nIt's a fun simulator as to what you would do during a retarded Zombie Apoc - one bite, and you're done.  \n\nStill, the gameplay is top notch.   Hunting down your zombie after you've died.  The music is nothing short of amazing.  And the graphics are classical cheese.\n\n10/10.",

            "review": "Since the start of Lightfall and even before that Bungie has started on a path of trying to kill the game instead of making it better. Constant server issues that only get worse with each week while hearing nothing from Bungie on why the issues are occurring, if they will get better, or if they can even be fixed. Mind numbing changes that only seek to hurt the players for no reason.\n\nThe most recent stompees nerf that removes all movement speed from the exotic due to controller players not being able to \"look up\". There is also the titan shoulder charge nerf that now causes you to lose energy after shoulder charging even if it does not hit an enemy. While being a PvP nerf, PvE is being hit by this nerf due to the developers dying on the hill of not separating the sandboxes. While this change may not seem that impactful, let me also add that shoulder charge has worked the same way for the last 9 years. Warlocks are getting starfire not just nerfed but murdered. Starfire has needed a nerf for a while as it is an extremely dominate exotic but instead of nerfing it to be more in line with other exotics the developers have almost made it a punishment to use the exotic. Grenade energy used to be 20% while in an empowering rift and is now down to 2.5%. Lastly, lets talk about the incredible band-aid fixes to the game. The 2 second weapon cooldown. Now if you ever swap weapons in your inventory you have to wait 2 seconds before you are allowed to fire your weapon in a SHOOTER. To give some examples this would be similar to not being able to use the brakes in your vehicle should you accidentally press them or be on a very busy interstate, instead you need to wait 2 seconds. \n\nFinally, there is the price increase of each expansion and now the increase in prices of seasons by an extra 5 dollars. I'm not even going to get into the costs of the game as in my stance I normally buy the most expensive edition as I play the game a lot unfortunately but going the cheaper route is even more expensive. From the expansions to now increased season price and dungeon keys the game is not only offering so little for that cost but also doing nothing to improve the game server wise, it's only getting worse.\n\nFor my last bit of advice, if you are new to the game or think about checking it out and never having played Destiny. \n\nSTAY FAR AWAY\n\nThis game is the most unfriendly new player experience I have ever witnessed. Playing through the New Light aka New player experience as an experienced person shows the issues with the game and what it's not teaching new players. The craziest part is this feedback has been given to Bungie the last 2-3 years now and yet they still refuse how to teach new players to play the game. Instead they teach new players how to play a game for their very first time. For instance, they teach you that \"Space Bar\" is jump instead of teaching you that weapons within destiny have different perk combinations on them, or that subclasses have different benefits and how to properly use them in combat.\n\nFrom recent events it is apparent that the team that worked on the game during the Beyond Light era and even the Witch Queen era is gone. They are either working on one of the 7 trillion new projects that Bungie has spread themselves too thin doing or went to a new game studio.",

            "review": "Destiny 2 is a black hole for your time.\n\nI find myself coming back every time a new piece of content is dropped, but this is out of no love of the content that I am receiving. Attempting to introduce Destiny 2 to new players reveals the number of fatal flaws this game's business model contains, namely that it's now essentially impossible for new people to get invested in Destiny as a franchise.\n\nOld content has been vaulted away, never to be seen again. This includes but is not limited to the original campaign that this game was offering as it's primary story (of which future content would build upon rather than replace). The story of Destiny 2 is unplayable within Destiny 2, all that remains are DLCs priced the same as full installments for AAA releases.\n\nLightfall was particulary dissapointing, but arguably the decline began in Shadowkeep, and even the original Red War campaign was never that good. The game is fundamentally a grind-fest, not to mention the numerous arbitrary limitations on resources and currencies to make that grind as painful and tedious as possible.\n\nHarder content that most dedicated players would say is the point of playing the game, like Raids and Dungeons, is either locked behind a seemingly endless line of filler content pretending to be story, or is locked behind a completely arbitrary power cap that is constantly increasing due to rampant power creep.\n\nI could go on but I don't need to.\nI will still continue to play this game, purely out of my sunk-cost fallacy.\nBungie, I liked you during the Halo days, but now you've turn sour.\n\nBring back ALL of the vaulted legacy content, remove all of the arbitrary limit on resources, and actually try to make a DLC campaign that does more than look nice and waste your time (and money). THEN, we'll talk.",

I never had the attitude that Bungie could do no wrong but I wanted to believe  they would continue to evolve the game and make it better. Lightfall launched and I felt like many, it was a huge disappointment and did little if nothing to evolve the franchise. I didn't even finish the campaign, and took a 2 week break from the game 2 weeks later, like someone in an abusive relationship, I decided to log back on and finish the campaign and other content I had paid 100 dollars for/ I was met with a message that said I was banned. This was very confusing to me seeing as I never used cheats or did anything I was aware of that was against T.o.s. There was no way to contact bungie  other than their terribly implemented forums. Upon submitting an appeal all I got in response was that the ban would not be overturned. They did not provide me with any reason as to why I was banned ( because there wasn't one ) . Myself and many others had thousands of hours of their time and over a thousand dollars of content  wrongly taken from them with no recourse and no explanation. I never thought i would say this but because of this i feel bungie is more predatory than activision/ blizzard  in this manner because even they would not issue a permaband with no explanation.\n\nTLDR\nDo not play this game unless you wish to have thousands of hours and dollars wrongly taken from you with no explanation why.Any one who gives a dime to this company is setting a dangerous precedent that gaming developers do not have to be accountable to the players who support them. If you're looking for a good mmo experience there are plenty of much better mmos . The game had potential 5 years ago and it was squandered . Not only that but Bungies had decided to cannibalize their most loyal player in a lukewarm attempt to be perceived as doing something to fix the many broken aspects of the game. I don't thing disappointed even sums up how i and many other feel about bungie,\n",

I dislike the game's business practices since they infringe on the gameplay and loot available. It's extremely repetitive on the seasonal level as Destiny attempts to be a game you give ALL your time to and its the same thing...every season...Play this game as much as you want but just know that all Bungie's hard work goes to their micro transaction store instead of game play. Save yourself countless hours. The grinds are not worth the highs in comparison to lows. Enjoy as you will I spent like 700 bucks on expansions and dlcs combines since all the days of D1. This game is FPS league of legends. Dont let your friends play it\n",

            "review": "Don't think I've ever played a fun, exciting game like this that actively suffers from timed content in such a prolific way. There are so many builds that rely on certain weapons that you can't obtain anymore. I'm a returning player who skipped all of Beyond Light Launch and onward until Lightfall, and god it is just so painful to see a cool build or a build that is *required* for some sub-classes to even function well in any meaningful content... And have the weapon that makes the build work require a catalyst that is now a random drop, or you can't even get anymore if you tried. Seasonal weapons have done a great job as the game's life as gone on to address pain points of boring loot and weak rolls, but now a player who has missed even just one season can be behind forever... Now there *are* ways for these weapons to 'come back'. With set rolls on vendors, at random completely indiscernible times for a week at most. I waited for a Calus Mini Tool SMG with demolition and/or Incandescent to be available all the first two seasons of Lightfall for my solar builds (builds that are now much weaker due to season of the deep's mods)... And it just hasn't reappeared. I had to settle for a much less effective weapon and weapon type I could craft just to function on my solar builds. This pattern is repeated with Arc builds this season, where my Thunderlord hasn't gotten a catalyst to drop and I have no good primary/special weapons for arc to use.\n\nDestiny is super fun, really! It's extremely exciting, the effects are all top-notch, enemy design is varied and there is alot of challenging raids and content... But, back when I was playing the game years ago, we didn't have to buy dungeons. We paid less for expansions and seasons, and retained the same amount of content. Now, not only has these been brought up in price, and dungeons now being sold separately from the normal game... Bungie are making more money every year then last. They are making two more brand new games, one of which was just announced. They are not doing this, nickle and diming every last piece of content, to make the game. They are doing it to make a profit. So, as such, these problems amount to alot of frustration. For now, unless you've been playing this game since it started or years prior to this review, avoid at all costs. It's not worth it, period.",

Also, community servers obviously have zero bots.\n\nWhat makes me love this game is how different the experience is from any other shooter, even to this day. There are many mechanics/features that I've never seen in any other game before. I think this games biggest strength, which is also a huge factor in enabling this kind of uniqueness, is the emphasis on fun over balance and silly nature of the game which leads to more open minded devs/players.\n\nThis isn't an approach that can work for many games, but this game has had about 16 years to refine the experience and it truly shows. Despite how bizarre so many aspects of the game are, the gameplay is quite well balanced, smooth, and has a very high skill ceiling which all combine to make for a very replayable title.\n\nAlso, I'd be remissed to not talk about the elephant in the room (Overwatch) so here we go. It's a mistake to consider playing this game pointless because of the existence of Overwatch. As mentioned there are many things in this game that I've never seen in any other game before, and that includes Overwatch. These games are VERY different from each other, and each class in TF2 has much more depth than any class in Overwatch, though Overwatch does have a much larger roster. You can like one game over the other, or you could be a fan of both. They are very different games and one does not negate the others quality.",

If you want to put yourself in a bad mood, just pick any public server and play a couple rounds.\n\n I WANT to like this game, I want to look at the scoreboard and see my name at the top. I want to win. I want a good K/D ratio, I want to feel like I supported my team, and to feel satisfied after a match. But I don't and I never will. I have over 660 hours in the game and I regularly lose. I get mad. I blame my team mates. I rage. I mald in chat. I change my class, and I still get killed. I get dominated by at least two players per match. in 660 hours and I should have learned SOMETHING but I still just barely outskill a fresh F2P. \n\nI'm not going to get good at this game, no matter how many more hours I put into this game. I'm just going to keep on losing and dying and getting mad and being salty. Instead of doing that, I'm going to uninstall the game, and try to not play it anymore. There is this small amount of naivety buried deep inside me that says if I just play for a little while longer, I'll get better, but that same voice said that same thing 100 hours ago.\n\nIf you want a challenging, teamwork based First Person Shooter, and you can tolerate losing, then this game is perfect for you. If you're akin to me, and want to play games you're skilled at, please, pick something else.",

If that is your cup of tea.\n\nGood thing is you can play it however you want. The game can be easy or hard as you want it to be.\n\nOverall, the experience is like having a weird dream. I'm just glad that I finished it so I can move on to the next game.  It didn't give me any empty feeling after finishing the first playthrough unlike when I finished The Witcher 3. It's a great game but not the best game of the decade. It's just because other games at the moment are all shit.",

I also still play it very actively. But not via steam. So me saying anything else than \"I love this game with every cell of my body and I am addicted\" would be a blatant lie. I also invested a lot of money already.\n\nIn short. This is a great game based on MANY factors. Variety, graphics, realism, teamplay, progression. I had so many great moments with this game and my friends that I could not list them all even with 100000 characters available.\n\nBUT. This game, or rather the company, is walking a very dangerous path for a long time now. But now they seem to have decided to commit to it 100%. And this way is to milk the playerbase the worst way possible. New expensive premiums, less and less rewards every patch, economy system, repairs etc. Its slowly becoming a joke. And they need to pull the hand brake. And they need to pull it hard.\n\nI am not writing this to hate on the game or the players. I am writing this because I love the game and I want it to thrive. But not via this way. Please Gaijin. Take this seriously. We are not asking to make this game 100% F2P. We know that you guys need to earn money. But this is too much. There must be other ways.",

            "review": "As much as it hurts to say, this game is rapidly going downhill for all the wrong reasons. I have played passionately for over 8 years, and the only thing I get in return is a harder grind due to ever changing \"economy\" updates, the inability to play what I want without opening up my wallet, and a straight up refusal to balance the game around the average player's skill.\n\nGaijin has become one of the greediest companies I have ever known, they advertise new modern equipment that you wont be able to play unless you grind for over 2 years. They also made it so the only way you can progress is by buying multiple $70 vehicles, most of which is just a tech tree vehicle with a sightly different camo. I will play until my already paid for premium time runs out, then will likely quit the game all together unless things change for the better.\n\nDon't let companies walk over you, you are just a number to them. The only way to see real change is to push back, and stop feeding them money.",

I would never recommend this game to anyone as it is in the worst state this game has ever been in. This game will disappoint you and waste your time and money. The community is toxic, the devs are clueless and must not play their own game, they just make fodder perks and skins leaving the dumpster fire they created behind to torment the fanbase. If they dont care about their game neither should you.

Muitas vezes você vai cair em salas lagadas sem saber o por que\n- Não sei por que a Behavior insiste no sistema de ranking pra um jogo casual. Isso faz com que muitas das partidas sejam frustrantes, PRINCIPALMENTE se você é main killer e tá aprendendo um boneco novo. Se você passa raiva fácil, fique longe da gameplay de Killer e só jogue de Survivor.\n- Comunidade tóxica : Não é de hoje que esse jogo tem uma galera chata. Se você não joga como os survivors querem, se prepare pra ser xingado ou reportado por só ter campado quando já tava no End Game da partida.\n- Jogar de Killer é frustração na certa, a menos que você só jogue com uns 2 ou 3 killers e domine eles. Mesmo assim, terá partidas que você será destruido e não há o que fazer. Infelizmente, a Behaviour não sabe balancear o sistema de ranqueamento (na real, nem devia existir tal sistema, a menos que tenha uma playlist competitiva) e o jogo no geral, com muitos perks de atraso de gerador sendo nerfados.\n- Ausência de uma área unicamente competitiva, já que eles insistem em manter um sistema de rankeamento.\n\nRESUMO\n\nO jogo é divertido, tem muito conteúdo e da uma dose de terror quando você tá começando no game, fora que jogar com amigos é muito bom, mas também pode ser frustrante jogar contra alguém que já tem +2000h do jogo e tryharda de Killer, ou uma party fechada de 4 survs que focam no famoso GEN RUSH. Infelizmente, a Behaviour não sabe balancear o game, e usa um sistema de pareamento de partidas horrível, com salas lagadas ou desequilibradas. Querem manter o ranking ? Botem um modo competitivo pra isso e deixa quem não liga pra rank jogar numa boa",

The game itself is simple to grasp, it's constant bickering and toxicity is what kills this game. I don't want to be part of it anymore on either side of it. Plenty of other games and genres to experience. \n\nIf you think of playing this game, go for it, but work on your skin conditioning if you catch my drift. If you are a streamer and plan to stream this game - simply, please don't. Find something else. The community hates streamers, specifically the toxic part of the community. The worst than that news is that that part specifically is not small in size in this game. It's better for your and your sanity, trust me on this.",

            "review": "Phasmophobia is a cooperative first-person horror game. It takes place in randomly generated procedural environments with ghosts whose behaviors vary. The object of the game is to identify the type of ghost, collect evidence and escape before time runs out.\n\nThe game is designed to be played cooperatively with up to four players each having a specific role on the team. (ghost solicitor, UV specialist, temperature expert, and sound detector). The operation of the equipment and game mechanics is well explained in the tutorial.\n\nGameplay revolves around investigation, information gathering, and communication to solve each ghost's mystery while trying to avoid being hunted down and killed by the ghosts in question.\n\nThe soundscape is effective in creating a tense and frightening atmosphere. Footsteps echoing through empty rooms or the sounds of ghosts giggling in the dark are great horror elements.\nThe level of difficulty depends on the complexity of the ghost, the composition of the team and the experience of the players. Advanced ghosts can be difficult to counter, however, team coordination and the efficient use of equipment can greatly improve the chances of success.\n\nThe procedural generation of investigations gives a wide variety of game experiences with novelties. Players never know what to expect in every investigation. The rooms, objects, clues and behaviors of each ghost are randomly generated thus offering completely different game experiences in each investigation.\n\nPhasmophobia is an excellent cooperative horror game that offers a unique gaming experience thanks to the randomly generated investigations, the scary atmosphere and the efficient gameplay.\n\nIn solo mode the game is very scary. Recommandation is to play with few light and a Dolby or Atmos sound device.\n\nMy rating: 16/20",

HOWEVER I would not play this game for a long time as I feel for me It is a game that I find hard to control, and also hard to keep up with if you you have 0 experience in the game..for new users.",

Every round is a whole new riddle to be solved.\nHowever what I like even more about Phasmo is the awesome community!\nFrom the random cool person in your public lobby to the helpers on the Discord. Obviously there still is toxicity, but compared to any other game Phasmophobia people are really friendly. :)\nThe devs are cool too. They're actually making the game better and better.\nAnd the best thing is: There is no pvp. Meaning I can be a very good player without the pressure of being better than anyone else lol",

But all those negative points are to be changed according to the 2023-2024 roadmap.\n \nGame is labelled early access but feels very polished, highly recommended !",

            "review": "This will be the first review I will ever write for a game but this is something that I have been passionate about for many years now and I figured Black Ops 3 would be the best game to write all of this about since it's a game that has been really special to me, that and Black Ops 2. \n\nThis is something bigger than just my own words, this is bigger than just COD. This is something that I never want to see replicated in any other gaming medium, through any other publisher or developer. The thought of this makes me feel physically ill. This is people's passion, heart, and soul being put into something only for it to be snuffed out, and I am just not for it in the slightest.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know, as of yesterday a couple tweets came out by the creators of the BOIII and Xlabs clients stating that Activision/Blizzard enforced a cease and desist order on them, forcing them to be shut down.\n\nAnyone who is unfamiliar with this, Xlabs is a fan made client launcher for the old Call of Duty games. They are one of the, if not, the ONLY alternative for playing these old games without the risk of hackers compromising your entire PC and therefore your private information. \n\nYou have Plutonium which is the client for Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, and World at War\n\nYou have Xlabs which is for Modern Warfare 2, Ghosts, and Advanced Warfare\n\nThen there was the newest client which is BOIII, which allowed you to safely play Black Ops 3. And I know quite a lot of people in my own friend group who still played these games, ESPECIALLY Black Ops 3 just for the modded Zombies scene.\n\nSo not only was SM2 shut down, but Xlabs and BOIII, literally the ONLY way you would have been able to play Black Ops 3 in a polished state, has been completely terminated. You can't even access their websites anymore. \n\nApparently there has been a lot of gossip going around about why SM2 was shut down and it was speculated by many that it was either because of the engine swap from the 2009 MW2 engine over to the more recent 2016 Modern Warfare Remastered engine and because of this, the developers of SM2 had to state that you no longer needed a Steam copy of MW2 in order to play the game in case there were people who bought the game before this change happened.\n\nBut what the hell is the excuse this time?? Xlabs, Plutonium, and BOIII not only required you to own purchased copies of these games in order to play, but they have been the ONLY solution for any one of us to be able to properly play games that we all grew up with because a. The official servers are dead as shit so you'll be waiting 45 minutes for a match to start if at all and b. These old games are INFESTED with hackers.\n\nThere exists FACTUAL EVIDENCE these games being completely swept by RCE exploits.\n\nAnyone who is unfamiliar with this, RCE stands for Remote Code Execution. An RCE is when an attacker accesses a target's computing device and makes changes remotely, no matter where the device is located. RCEs have a broad category of attacks that can either have minor effects on a victim's system, but they can also be quite serious.\n\nAn example of an RCE is the WannaCry ransomware worm which spreads by exploiting a vulnerability in the Server Message Block Protocol (or SMB for short). This vulnerability is what allows an attacker to execute malicious code on a person's machine, enabling ransomware to access and encrypt valuable files.\n\nNeroCinema is a prominent voice in the Call of Duty community and has been a victim to one of these rat exploit attacks while just trying to play Black Ops 2 on PC on vanilla servers, because remember, these old games still use peer to peer connectivity unlike these days where we have moved onto dedicated servers because Activision/Blizzard are so bad at their job that they can't even do the bare minimum requirements necessary to keep these games up to date.\n\nDo you wanna know what would happen if you tried to play some Black Ops 2 or Black Ops 3 Zombies with your friends running on the official servers? I'll put it lightly\n\nYou\nAre\nSCREWED\n\nAnd don’t bother dusting off that old PS3 because even on Console, these games are riddled with dead lobbies, and if you do manage to find a lobby, it’s full of cheaters. \n\nThis is a whole new level of despicable if I have ever seen it. Activision/Blizzard are actively selling 10+ year old games on Steam such as Black Ops 1, 2, and 3 as well as Modern Warfare 2 and 3, still retailing them at $50-60 and are charging full price for all of the DLC, they do not update their games so that everyone can actually safely play them, so when the community turns around and decides to do THEIR job and fix their shit for them, FOR FREE might I add, Activision responds by shutting down any chances of there being any possible way to play these games.\n\nSo now we are stuck at a standstill with there being NO way to play like, half these COD games anymore, and I bet your ass it won't be long until they go after Plutonium next.\n\nThis is Black Ops 2 we're talking about here, one of my favorite games of all time. And it's just going to be deleted from history, all for the sole purpose of getting people to play their gutter trash new games and spend $30 on their Battle Passes and buy their 3000 COD Point bundles. \n\nWell you know what, I may be just one person, but I don't care, I’m taking a stand against this. I’m not gonna sit around playing with my thumbs as I watch as my childhood burns right before my eyes. As of yesterday I uninstalled my Blizzard launcher. And I would suggest you do the same. Do not, and I beg of you, DO NOT support this company any longer. \n\nDo not buy any more of their games, do not buy skins in any of their games, just don’t even bother booting up their games anymore. Hell, don't even pirate these games. It is not worth it.\n\nBecause they have proven time and time again that you are nothing more than a disposable piece of garbage but with an income. And as a matter of fact, I’m taking this even further. They should not be allowed to sell these games on the Steam storefront. So I’m going to do what I have never done before and I’m going to submit report tickets of these games to Valve. Do you want to help me? It’s up to you. I’ll even assist you on how to do it.\n\nJust for the record, the games that are affected by these RCE exploits are\n\nWorld at War\nModern Warfare 2 (2009)\nBlack Ops 1\nModern Warfare 3\nBlack Ops 2\nGhosts\nAdvanced Warfare\nBlack Ops 3\n\nFirst, go on any store page for any of these Call of Duty games, then scroll down until you see the flag icon on the right side, and check the box that says \"Harmful\"\n\nThen in the box as you write your report, make sure you mention the exploit CVE-2018-20817. Anyone that is unfamiliar with this, CVE-2018-20817 is the name of the RCE exploit which allows attackers to execute code on the user’s PC when sending an authentication request to Steam when trying to play any of these old COD games which is where the damage happens.\n\nAnd until Activision gets taken to court over blatantly breaking the law by ignoring this widespread problem, they won’t do anything about it because they don’t give two shits about any of their fans' feedback.  \n\nThis is a clear violation of consumer rights law, because if they are going to sell you a product, especially if they still retail it at full price, and provide services to the consumer, they are, BY LAW, obligated to protect the consumer from any harm from using said products. So if you ever want to make a tweet or something at them saying they can get sued for not abiding by this, well then there you go. \n\nBecause if you tried to submit a ticket to customer support to address this issue to them and have them try to fix it, they will either hang up on you, or just close your case without responding back to you. I'm not joking. That is how bad this situation has gotten. And it will continue to happen until you start holding them accountable.\n\nThank you and take care.",

I can't even describe it accurately -- it's a special blend of jank which feels impossible to wrangle. It's better to run solo than use them.\n\nEnemy AI would be really good, but every enemy has terminator accuracy, can track you through walls, and can eat anywhere from three to five .308 JHP battle rifle rounds fired center-of-mass from 15 feet (without body armor, btw). How tactical. Such realism.\n\nMeanwhile, you're an anemic slug with severe tremors and atrophied wrists.\n\nWhat a frustrating experience.

            "review": "[b]This game is a broken mess.[/b] Actually, calling it a \"game\" is already quite a stretch. It is an open BETA at best. As of May 2023, the AI is still broken, the communication between the development team and the player base is still non-existent, most maps are still not optimized, with a price tag that shouts CASH GRAB.\n\nI remember when RON first came out and it was just like any other new releases from developers we have never heard of: unpolished, lacking content, no end in sight. Just another FPS. Then came a period of time where RON seems to have found a new burst of energy, an overnight rise to fame, capturing everyone's attention as the \"new tactical shooter\" and \"successor to SWAT4\". Every single YouTuber who does milsim / FPS started covering this game, and everyone was singing the highest praises. It was at that point when I decided, fuggit Imma swallow that pill and pay the ludicrous asking price for a game that barely ran.\n\nAnd to my surprise, it was great fun! Knowing nothing at all about the behavior of the suspects and having zero map knowledge, I went into the game exploring all the missions and loadouts, experimenting with tactics and messing around with my best mate. That was the best month of 2022 for me personally. \n\nThen things started stalling out. As time went on, the warm and rosy tint of a new, refreshing game wears off, and the ugly side of RON started to show. AIs were terrible from the beginning; a common gangster off the streets of LS can somehow be the fastest hand in the west, making ROE impossible to follow (why would you alert a literal aimbot of your presence by shouting at them? That is if they haven't killed you already). Frames rates were not great but manageable, but it would never really improve either, with the exception of Hotel. All of this I can put up with, [u]but I am losing it when it comes to communication.[/u]\n\nI am very much aware that there are other venues the devs use to communicate with the playerbase, but one cannot ignore the fact that Steam IS the platform. Not just the platform for VOID to publish their stupid newsletters, but the very place where the game is launched every single time someone tries to play RON. I still remember scrolling through the feed and reading what the devs had to say about updates, and you can literally see the interaction between VOID and the community going downhill. \n\nAt first, the developmental updates would address the concerns raised by the players, and either acknowledge that a fix is WIP or announce that it would be patched in a planned update. The comment section would be filled with useful feedbacks and suggestions. Gradually, the devs started falling behind on their schedule, and they communicated that to the community telling everyone they needed more time to work out the kinks. Naturally this was also faced with strong support from the playerbase; after all, we all would prefer a more polished game versus one that was rushed out for the sake of meeting deadlines.\n\nThen the devs just stopped their old updating schedule entirely. Not only did they stop talking to the community about the problems they were facing during development and how they are going about fixing them, they also drastically reduced the update frequency to about once every six months. ALL OF WHICH would have been ok if not for their tone-deaf, one way and outright insincere communication. Newsletters, community exhibits, developmental updates that are actually not updates but just another newsletter... What this conveys to us players is that VOID clearly has the time to do SOMETHING, just NOT WHAT THE PLAYERS DEEM TO BE IMPORTANT. \n\nSchool map? Delayed indefinitely (be it due to controversy or other difficulties). AIs that are either gods or dumb as a cow with no in-between? Still the case despite all the fancy animations they added. Performance? You better be prepared to play Hotel forever if you want more than 3 digit FPS on even a modern rig. The basics people, FFS! Don't come telling us how you plan to implement all this useless gimmicks if you cannot even get the base game to work properly. New suspect traps (remember the saw-off attached to a door)? What new traps? Update coming by the end of next week? What update? VOID has also gotten the disgusting habit of going back on themselves without offering any explanation. It has gotten so bad that their \"new\" newsletters are just \"here is (trivial thing) we are working and a picture of a shoe\". This is just sad.\n\nLook, I am not saying that I can make a better game. Hell, I can barely throw together a coherent line of code in python. What I am saying is VOID needs to really work on their PR, especially on steam. Stop giving us this newsletter crap. We paid for the frankly exorbitant price tag to support the development of a new cult classic, not some useless bloat posted with some random jpeg. Every newsletter sent out has been an insult to those who actually cared about the game and very much want to see it succeed. The simps will defend this behavior all day long, arguing that people are just crybabies who get upset the moment they cannot get what they want, but remember:\n\n[h1] WE ARE NOT CRYBABIES. WE ARE GAMERS WHO TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH IN VOID WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONETARY INVESTMENT. WE HAVE WAITED PATIENTLY AND HELPED WHERE EVER WE COULD, BUT THIS IS NOT THE TREATMENT WE DESERVE. [/h1]\n\nDo not try to fool us by pretending that work is underway. Be straight, talk to us about the actual progress of the game and take community feedback seriously. If there is a setback, let us know. Tell us about the delays so that we are kept informed. The more you try to act as if everything is ok, the more distrust brews. I legitimately hope that VOID would reach a turning point where they realize that they have lost touch with the playerbase, the very people who made them what they are, and re-engage with the community in meaningful ways. \n\nEdit: also remember the whole Mod.io nonsense, where VOID promised to bring in modding support through steam workshop. I wonder what happened afterwards and why is the modding community for RON so small compared to other titles. Hmm, what could have possibly caused that?",

Subjects can sprint while you cannot, you can only tactically walk and the tactically walk slower.  Firearms do not accurately represent the real life versions. Firearm accessories are also not realistic you would mount a \"not Inforce WML\" on top of a P90 where your entire hand can not reach the activation button. The dev team spent time rendering a flaccid \"bird man penis\" for arguably the worst level rather than fix more glaring issues. Situations are not realistic. Terrorists from Yemen in the middle of committing a mass shooting are generally not considered \"barricaded suspects\". The dynamic animations cannot be stopped for any reason, it is painfully frustrating when you are ambushed and you can not cancel a shotgun reload (you will reload all 8 shells or die trying) or cancel a handcuff animation. The only alternative is to manually reload a single shell at a time which is equally frustrating.",

            "review": "At this point, I can no longer recommend this game with any good faith. My primary issues with the game are as follows:\n\n1. \"Early Access\" and the \"Supporter Edition\": One of the reasons stated for placing the game in early access was \"[i]to collect feedback and make larger changes to the game that couldn't happen if it was 'final'[/i]\". This would be fine, if VOID interactive didn't hard-lock some of the content they want tested behind a paywall. The normal, non-sale price for this game is $40 USD, which is already steep for a game in Early Access, that is not complete, and not in a shippable state. There is an additional \"Supporter\" tier that, while a frustrating addition, seeing that purchasing the normal Early Access edition is already made to support the game through development, is made even more egregious by being given multiple weeks access to updates before other players. This feels like a slap in the face to players who don't want to, or cannot shell out an extra $70 USD for the supporter edition. It's understandable that people who pay for the supporter edition receive some benefit, but temporarily hard locking content that YOU WANT TO IMPROVE AND WORK ON BUG FIXES FOR is not the way to successfully. Beyond early access to updates, the game's test branch is also hard locked behind the supporter edition paywall. This does not make sense. This feels like a greedy cash grab, and based on this alone, I would not recommend the game.\n\nUnfortunately, there's even more.\n\n2. The file size and lack of optimization: Ready or Not is 90 GB. The game used to run smoothly, and had a pretty good file size. After multiple updates, adding more content, I was prepared for the file size to climb, and was quite accepting of this. However, the climb from 40 GB in 2021 to 90 GB as of the most recent update is frankly insane. On top of this, with every update, multiplayer, and even single player, has become even more unstable. I can't play online with my friends anymore as at least one of them is disconnected or experiences a crash, freeze, or massive frame rate drops in every game we go into. I fully understand that this game is early access, and is subject to crashes, and things not working properly, but the rate at which this occurs is remarkably frustrating. \n\n3. The lack of updates: There have been just about two major updates in the entire history of the game. One major content update in June of 2022, and the Adam Update in December of 2022. There were some smaller content updates before the June one, but much of the time they were adding incomplete maps. There has been little communication regarding the progress of future updates, with VOID Interactive instead posting about the modding community, and how much work they have been doing. While I appreciate the modding community, and love how much modders add to the community, it feels like an absolute cop-out on VOID's part. It feels like VOID is using the skills of the modders, and the love they have for the game, to make up for the lack of updates on their part.\n\nWhile I could go further on things like the AI, lack of effective suppression, and lack of realism in some aspects (like the ABYSMALLY slow running speed), those are all things that are relatively acceptable in an early access game. Those are teething issues, and I feel like I've already touched on the big three aspects that bring the game down. In it's current state, I cannot recommend that anyone purchase the game.",

AI needs having another look at due to it's flaws. Enemy's spawn kill, they also know exactly where you are majority of the time. 1 last thing to do with the enemy AI is that some structures they seem to be able to shoot through and i can't. The audio has it's issues as well which doesn't help. Unfortunately there is no progression system and everything is just about the same when it comes to the different modes. I know for a fact people get put off when there is nothing to work towards.\n\nIf the game doesn't fix & improve on what needs to be done then i can't recommend this. This early access nonsense these days is just a joke. A lot of game can't fulfill there potential due how the industry operates today. such a shame. No wonder i always go back to the classics.",

In fact, if you've played Rainbow Six 3 or any of the earlier R6 games, this game will feel VERY familiar to you. Ready or Not basically feels like a 2020s remastered version of Rainbow Six 3. \n\nThat being said, the game feels like it lacks depth as a result. There is no mission planning or level maps, which IMO are sorely needed. Even though the shooting mechanics are very fun and the graphics are great, the game itself feels kind of tired, because it uses such an old school gameplay formula from basically 20 years ago.\n\nI'd say this game is okay. It isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either. The AI and all the bugs could still use some work, at least as of this writing. If you are looking for a game that is basically one of the old slow-paced tactical shooters from the mid 00's, but with modern day shooting mechanics and graphics, you would probably like this game.",

            "review": "Street Fighter 6 is not only Capcom getting back in the saddle as part of the pantheon of fighting games makers, it's an evolution of the genre as a whole.\n\nIf you have even the slightest interest in fighting games this is a must buy. The game is bursting with beginner friendly tutorials that can either be simple instructions or deep, precise, dives into frames and advantage states and such, including a deep selection of tutorials and challenges for each character to help you fully grasp them. Each character feels distinct too, they may have overlapping general 'niche' roles but nobody feels 'surplus' or 'padded'. Manon and Zangief may be both grapplers, but Manon's slow build momentum focus is a world apart from Big Z's brutal command grab heavy arsenal of unrelenting high risk high reward offense.\n\nMultiplayer is smooth and easy, able to be accessed from both the fantastic hub world full of fun details or just from the main menu if you want to jump right in, and provides plenty of chances to learn your way up the rankings before being thrown in with the pros.\n\nThe option to switch between classic and 'modern' controls is great as well. Modern in no way feels like 'easy mode' or some crutch either, you sacrifice complexity for ease, and it's up to you to decide if easier supers and combos is worth losing some of the granularity of full control over your character's inputs. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' control system and you'll be matched with both types online, it's a preference issue rather than anything else.\n\nSingleplayer is equally well thought out, though. Arcade mode gives nice simple fights to explore a character and good story rewards, but the real star is it's massive World Tour mode where you make your own avatar to travel the world of Street Fighter meeting mentors and learning their styles. The overall story is fairly bland but the real draw is getting to find Chun-Li in Chinatown and get her to train you and building a relationship with her as a mentor to the point where you're texting with her randomly in the world and learning about what she's been up to since the past games as well as mastering her iconic moves.\n\nThat's a detail that seems to go overlooked at times, this is the first SF game in ages to move the story forward. Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, they've all progressed as characters and have experiences to share instead of being the same rather flat characters we've seen for decades at this point. It feels like a proper 'passing of the torch' in some ways too, there's likely to never be a SF game without the 'core' cast like Ryu but the story lets the new blood feel like genuine up and coming street fighters to watch out for rather than just random additions.\n\nThis is the Street Fighter most of us have been waiting ages for, and if you have even a passing interest in fighting games this is going to be a fantastic one to learn on.",

            "review": "[h1]Preface[/h1]\nAs much as I HATED SF5's launch and lifespan, Street Fighter 6 has brought the SF series to a whole new level. I despised the days when Capcom started releasing 5-6 versions of the game with characters locked behind the paywall. Unfortunately, I can see SF6 doing the same already and it's somewhat become a norm in the FGC to do this for the past several years. It's one of those love-hate relationships that we have; on one hand, we hate the entire gaming industry for such scummy practices. On the other, we see it as a way to support our favorite fighting games by throwing our money at these companies. Whatever controversial take there may be, to each his own.\n\nI will admit, however, that I am guilty as charged for having a double standard against certain companies for monetization practices. Fortunate or unfortunate, I go easier on fighting games for some reason...\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n[b]Mechanics[/b]\nSA, Drive Impact/Parry, Rushdown - this is Street Fighter in its prime. The smoothness and flow of combat is what defines a fighting game. New fighting game mechanics are always hit or miss (there is no in-between) and Capcom took a risk worth taking with the Drive gauge. It's not too overwhelming and it definitely is a game-changer in many cases based on my 50-or-so casual matches that I had with a friend I consider an \"eternal rival\" in every fighting game we get our hands on.\n\n[b]Content[/b]\nOne of the biggest controversies that SF5 faced in its early days was the abysmal lack of content that it suffered from on launch day. Glad to see SF6 does not face the same issue here, with World Tour mode being in the spotlight to attract newer players to the franchise with its beginner-friendly and adventure-game like elements, which are always welcome additions to the generally hardcore nature of fighting games. Other than that, SF6 on launch comes with other modes that a solid fighting game should have. The extreme battles were also a surprising addition to the fray, offering a variety of different battle conditions should you find yourself bored with the normal K.O. fights.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[b]Monetization & Paywalls[/b]\nAs I mentioned before, I can see the many different versions of SF6 being released over the next few years as more characters and content is released. Prepare for SF6: Arcade Edition, SF6: Ultra Edition, and SF6: Prepare-to-kill-your-wallets Edition by 2030!!\n\n[b]No Custom Rooms (YET)[/b]\nThe Hub is pretty amazing in and of itself, but I was utterly disappointed when my friend and I were unable to create custom rooms. LOLWUT\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[b]Final Verdict: S[/b]\nIn its current, base form, Street Fighter 6 has brought the franchise to new heights with relatively enjoyable new mechanics, a solid World Tour mode with a fantastic customization options for CAC, and smoother-than-ever combat. Just waiting to see how greedy Capcom gets with this game... it's gonna be milkable AF, that's for sure.",

            "review": "I’m not sure how I’ll rate the game going forward, and not a fan of early reviews. However, the game has a confusing and unfortunate amount of monetary schemes that, as far as I can tell, haven’t been covered in game reviews. I’m just trying to offer a fair warning for people that might be bothered by them, as I am.\n\nFor one, the game has a battle pass, with a premium version to be worked in later. No specifics beyond that, but inevitably charging for battle pass antics in a $60 game is poor form. There’s also rental fighter passes, that allow you to test an unowned character for a whopping hour. With other games just periodically swapping fighters out, this seems like a limited and rather poor way to allow players to see what other characters are about.\n\nThe next thing confuses me a bit. Paid currency has an expiration date… in Japan? I guess it’s not a problem if it doesn’t affect the rest of the world… maybe. I’ve got to re-read the blurb when I get an opportunity. There’s also advertisements on the Battle Hub banners, which is nice.\n\nFinally, as far as I can see, you can only get drive tickets from challenges. There are daily, weekly and monthly challenges that offer kudos, which give you titles for the characters you use, and drive tickets. Currently, only the monthly one offers drive tickets, at 500 per successful challenge. The cheapest shop items cost 2,000. At that rate, you can get one cheap shop item every four months, unless you spend cash.\n\nOverall, I’m not trying to tell anyone how to feel about all this; I’m just trying to inform people so they can make their own decisions about them. Some of these elements may change over time, but the fact that I’ve seen them in no reviews (only reading Destructoid’s and IGN’s) and don’t recall any of these things in the demo or the open beta suggests that they were snuck in. At least World Tour - for now - seems free of all this malarkey. Though it has weird performance issues on the Steam Deck - some fights run smooth enough, some play out in slow motion, with no evidence of framerate hitching involved. It’s been fun otherwise, for the hour and change I’ve played it.\n\nEDIT: Destructoid’s review actually covers some, if not all, of this. My tired brain just forgot. IGN’s review makes zero mention of this - that I saw, anyway.",

The performance issues have mainly persisted within World Tour mode.\n\nThe game drops to 20 fps or lower and just stays there until I restart the game. I never had this problem in the betas, so it can only be attributed to the addition of Denuvo. I will quote Gabe Newell about this forever.\n\"The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It’s by giving those people a service that’s better than what they’re receiving from the pirates.\"\n\nAnti-piracy only ever hurts paying customers and you would hope Capcom learned that with RE8, but here we are. Many people are having no problems. But many people are having this problem.",

            "review": "I'll put this here just to filter my thoughts out. \nI do play (still unfortunately) since the initial release of the game.\nApologies upfront for any spelling mistakes I make in this text.\n\nCONS:\n1. This game is NOT casual/F2P friendly in any way possible even though it might act like it. \n- Yes, even though game does provide you with \"a lot\" of free stuff to progress your character/s, the overwhelming grind you have to do to actually achieve a \"proper\" endgame expirience overshadows all of it.\n- If you hear that this game feels like \"having a new job\" sort of way, it is indeed true.\n- For each one of these \"problems\" or lets say non casual friendly \"mechanics\" I am going to list here, I could make a separate paragraph how it corrupts the whole gameplay expirience:\nGatekeeping, FOMO, Absurd amount of toxicity especially in raids, RNG on casino level,... this is pretty much constant daily expirience for even most of veteran players till this date... \n\n2. Game design is corrupted to the core with INSANE amount of RNG systems to progress your character. \n- Do not get me wrong here... I like a lot of systems which provide you way to progress... however in this gamem every single one is pretty much full fledged casino expirience... it is RNG fiesta at this point.\n- The only thing that has a so called \"pity meter\" where you are pretty much \"garanted\" a successful character progression in some period of a time is honing (enchanting your main set of gear).\n- Every other character progression system is a predatory RNG system designed for you to spend some cash or spend that \"new job\" amount of time to be successful and achieve what you aim for. (Yes, MMOs are supposed to be grindy... that completely fine and that also part of why I like this genre... this game however takes this topic to a whole different lvl worth of paragraph itslef.)\n\n3. Things I have already mentioned before such as: Gatekeeping, FOMO, Toxicity, RNG, are not an uncommon occurrence even in MMO genre. However, what I do have to say is that even after thousands of hours spent in different MMOs (and other generes), I had never expirienced these issues to have such a hard impact on the playerbase itself, the game is literaly repulsive to play after a while with all of that negative expirience.\n\nPROS:\n1. Great combat!\n- The combat this game has is quite an expirience. Every single class does feel unique and well designed it its own way. Combat wise this game is pleasure to play.\n\n2. Immerse endgame PVE expirience. \n- The whole part of raids, \"legion raids\", that this game offers at endgame is arguably one of the best in whole MMO genre.\n- You have to learn certain mechanics to be successful, but its worth it. From cinematic point of view to music... that part is worth of some time to expirience it .\n\n3. Somewhat decent graphics. The asymetric camera point of view is also quite well designed.\n\nSummary:\nWith all things considered, I just can't and will not recommend this game to any new, casual or F2P player.\nIn my opinion, the game is great in its own ways with tremendous potential to grow and fix certain issues that players do provide as a feedback. However I do not see that hapenning in any near future or at all to be honest, since many changes that \"community\" feels like they should be implemented just do colide with that predatory game design they have.\nThe scale of changes that would have to happen in game to be fun for new players and also keep veteran players invested for longer seems to be to great to actually happen.\nIt would probably just lose AGS and Smilegates a lot of money generation they got implemented in the game systems and well... nobody likes losing money right?",

            "review": "This game has extremely fun content that I love playing, but this review will focus on the negative side of the game.\n\nThere are so many barriers to get to the fun content that new players will have an awful time getting there. The game has an account level system that is an accumulation of the experience from all of your characters combined. People will not accept you into groups if that level is not high enough. The developers are adding catch up mechanics and systems but they do not have any way to help players catch up with experience and an outdated card system in the game that takes months/years to complete due to random chance packs and is becoming a standard requirement in the late game making it hard on new players.\n\nDon't let the single player tag fool you into thinking you can play this game completely solo because you will need to play with other players due to Legion Raids being a requirement to upgrade your gear to experience higher level content. There is plenty of solo content in the game, but that is not the most satisfying and well designed content the game has to offer.\n\nThere are outdated monetization systems in the game that people have vocalized their discontent about and the developers refuse to remove them. It is one of the main reasons why the majority of players quit the game and it's not something you will be able to avoid.\n\nEven though the game has great content, I do not recommend this game to new players because of the amount of gate keeping new players experience from the community, and the reason the gate keeping exists is because of the amount of playtime that is required on all of your characters to earn gold and build up that account experience. If you only play one character, you won't have the account level that is acceptable when looking for a party. The global and Korean community has complained and provided solutions to this many times but the developers refuse to update this making this game feel like a tedious second job that you have to play daily for hours.",

I quit the game few months ago mostly due to the amount of time you need. \nThey say most games are either pay-to-win or extremely time consuming to keep up with the rest of the community, this game actually requires both...\n\nPros-\n-graphic is decent, characters are very pretty\n-game play is nice, requires you to actually know what you are doing with your class/skills etc\n-upgrading gear has a pity system so at least you know there is a \"end\" (even if it costly you tons of gold/material regardless)\n-community --this is variable since i started the game since it came out, if you are new, likely it is difficult to keep up and you will likely get yelled at alot\n\nCons- (two major ones)\n-EXTREMELY time consuming, let me tell you why: if you want to just focus on one character (like many other MMORPGS), this game is NOT for you. By having alts, they can contribute to income for resources/gold/material for you to hone. Each character have their own individual daily chaos dungeons/bosses, weekly raids/quests. Looking back, I spent somewhere between 6-8 hours a day playing this just to get daily/weeklies done on 6 characters, that is usually not maintainable for most people with a regular worklife\n-RNG system / cost: just spending time doesn't really get you the stuff you need. game has alot of in-game purchases for cosmatics/packs that you kinda need to get cards/honing mats. The game does give out free stuff frequently, but if you want to do the raids as soon as they come out, those will not be nearly enough. So that means if you REALLY want to keep up, more often than not you will need to pay real money for in-game stuff, especially if you are not playing 6-8h+ per day on 6+ alts. \n-some of the raids are really unforgiving, this could be frustrating for alot of people since there is always that ONE person out of eight people that screws up that ONE mechanism and wipe the raid the 50th times at 3AM in the morning.... But this goes back to \"you really need to know what you are doing\", so it depends on who is reading this. \n\n\nOverall, I love the game, but for a REGULAR person, unless you are really casual and just want to do a daily quest/boss kill for fun here and there and don't really care much about anything else, then this game is NOT for you. You really need to be semi-hardcore PLUS willing to spend cash to stay on the front line when raids come out etc. \n",

            "review": "Hi-Fi RUSH is a reminder that you don't need ultra realistic graphics and physics or open world & a massive multiplayer to be a good game. Playing Hi-Fi RUSH felt like re-playing a timeless classic such as Okami HD, Super Mario 64 or Psychonauts, but made for the modern era. The whole time playing felt like I was watching an interactive comic turned into anime. Before I started to play Hi-Fi RUSH, being a rhythm game I thought only combat would be on a beat, but I was wrong because when I actually started to play it I realised that the ENTIRE WORLD INTERACTIONS ARE SYNCHRONISED TO MUSIC! Mind blowing concept! Gameplay is smooth, art style is fantastic, the soundtrack is awesome & the challenge is superb! My last note is that I did not encounter a single bug or a crash which is a surprise because in the past decade or so, every newly released game was unplayable & some companies took years to fix their products, but not this game. It's truly a flawless masterpiece and I can't praise it enough. Well done Tango Gameworks and Bethesda Softworks, because you made a game that I will fondly remember for ages!",

It have ten licensed music tracks throughout the story and all of them fits perfect to where you at in the game right now and the boss fights. I can guarantee you 100$ or more that you will jam to one of these soundtracks FOR SURE. The [b]Gameplay[/b] is rhythm-based where you will need to perfect time hit a button to perform QTE or just the combat of this game and i appreciate that in this game it is not necessary to perfect time every hit thanks to the design of the rhythmic traits ( except few must needed parts which are pretty easy ). Even in order to help you find your rhythm, the whole world of Hi-Fi Rush pulses with the beat of whatever music is currently playing, providing you with both visual and audio cues for nailing its timing.You get different skills / combat moves as you progress through the game and they are easy to learn through good tutorial for each of them. The [b]Story[/b] of Hi-Fi rush is also very well written and keeps you entertain throughout the time you spend on it. It starts off with [spoiler] [b]Chai[/b], a 25-year old man with a disabled right arm and a dream to become a rockstar, arrives at the Vandelay Technologies campus to volunteer for Project Armstrong, a test program for cybernetic limb replacement. Unbeknownst to Chai, the CEO, Kale Vandelay secretly designates Chai to be a garbage collector for the company’s waste management [/spoiler] and how you go on from there ( pacing ) is well done IMO. It is a straightforward story BUT there are fun twist and turns throughout it. Other than that the [b]Boss fights[/b] were super fun to beat and the characters are REALLY REALLY well written, fun to hang around with, to learn about them and [b]Chai, the main hero of this game [/b] is super well voice acted, funny and just you just get to love him in this game. The game looks visually stunning to look at. Performance is also super well optimized with me having 60fps throughout it and you can get above that also with powerful GPU\n\n[b]OVERALL, Hi-Fi Rush Shadow-dropping tactic by [u]Tango Gameworks[/u] was a very brilliant and smart move and this game is a MUST-PLAY if you are into listening / jamming to good soundtrack and rhythm-based games, Worth all the price of it ( or play it on Gamepass which makes is 2 times worth it )[/b]\n\n[h2]Game Link:[/h2]\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/\n\n[url=https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/hi-fi-rush] Hi-Fi Rush on GamePass [/url]",

This game is outstanding and deserves even more love than it gets already!\n\nFrom the devs that made... *checks notes* THE EVIL WITHIN?!? Daaaaaaaaamn their comedy and art direction in this is S-Tier! The game plays like an old Gamecube/PS2/OG-Xbox era action platformer, with rhythm attributes in the mix. You can tell that a lot of love went into this game, from the stage design, combat feel, to the voice acting. This game has charm in spades and then some, and runs really well too!\n\nI've only rarely encountered minor stuttering, but it's not enough to detract from the experience. It's only really happened to me when I was in a traversal segment and there's not much going on anyhow. Other than that, it's been completely bug-free so far.\n\nAlso, one of the big bads is a reference to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure and the weeb in me squeals with delight. I also love the nods to The Evil Within with some robo-ified Sebastian and Joseph cameos.\n\nThis game honestly deserves your money even at full price. The amount of detail and love put into this game is insane and exactly what the industry needs in this day and age!",

Character customisation is also much better in this game, not just for cosmetics but for gameplay as well. Fallen Order has 3 skill tree pathways whereas Survivor starts you off with 7, with 2 more unlocking later in the game. I found myself struggling to choose between the different upgrades which was much better than the far more linear skill tree of Fallen Order.\n\nWhile the game itself is great the technical issues are just so bad. At first I thought I was getting alright performance, like around 40+ frames at 1080p, but it just got so much worse, going anywhere between 10-30 frames at 720p medium settings. Plus the game bugs out on the visuals and goes all black and white and all weird, plus the Mogu is so annoying cause if you die to it, all your xp disappears.\n\nI love this game but it has some serious issues, I just can't recommend it",

But to have the game crash mid cut-scene after a stupid hard/buggy boss, not saving and forcing me to go back through that. \n\nNo. Just NO. \n\nThat is my limit.\nIts not even the first time this has happen. Not to mention the roll on the dice If my dlc is working or not. Plus the mandatory need for internet connection for the SINGLE PLAYER Game.\n\n I received an error message at one point telling me that because the game couldn't connect to EA's servers my save file couldn't be verified, that I should wait 5 minutes or I run the risk of losing my save. \n\nWhat on earth is that.\n\n I want to love this, I tried to, I even tried convincing my friends that its not so bad, but god EA has made that impossible. \n\nIt feels like the game had need to prove me wrong. \n\nWell guess what, I was wrong, It is that bad.\n\n I'm done.",

Game play and world is a huge step up from the previous, a solid 9/10 for me. Respawn makes incredible single player games. I wish EA was not the publisher however, they rushed the launch before a optimized PC port was fine tuned, resulting in performance issues for most. Since launch a couple of patches have improved performance, however ray traying at the time of this review will still likely cause crashes. And the EA app needed to run the game can be a pain. \n\nA must play if you are a fan of star wars.",

However, i have to give this a complete thumbs down and will be requesting a refund until the issues are worked out. My personal opinion, this game was released way before the kinks and bugs were addressed. And the fact that you have to have internet in order to play the game is just all out RIDICULOUS !!!!! We have paid good money for this game and should be able to play it when we want, where we want, and should not have to worry about internet !!! You really need to re-think and correct your ERROR.....",

The first time they released an update that supposedly helped PC performance, it didn't really do much. However, after the most recent patch I noticed a significantly better play experience. I would like to see these negative reviews edited to reflect on their current performance so that we can see how others might have been helped (or not helped) by recent updates, since I personally am having a great time.\n\nI play on maximum settings at 1440p and get a solid 60-100 fps everywhere in the game now.\n\nMy Specs:\nCPU: Ryzen 3700x\nGPU: 3060 Ti\nRAM: 16GB\nWindows 10\n\nI have had a wonderful experience with Jedi Survivor. If you are a fan of the first game, the sequel improves upon nearly every piece. Customization is far more varied, there are now five entirely different lightsaber stances (dual-wielding is my personal favorite), combat feels satisfying and powerful, and the level design is absolutely gorgeous. Also, there are far more skills to gain as you level up, making progression much more interesting in my opinion. As with the first one, I felt genuinely invested in the story, and most of the characters have so much heart.\n\nAgain, if you like Star Wars and/or liked Fallen Order, this is genuinely a fantastic game to buy (and certainly better than most of EA's Star Wars).",

EA will never stop pressuring developers with crunch-times and deadlines just so that they can pander to investors and shareholders about how much progress they're making while actually doing none of the work. \n\nIt is impossible for me to look past the glaring optimization issues, crashes, EA's malware (or launcher, depending on how you look at it), and enjoy the game for what it was meant to be. Why? Because it only works half the time, at least for most people. With the release of patch #5 as of May 17th, people are reporting even WORSE performance, and I respect myself enough to choose to not deal with issues that never should've been there to begin with. The whole thing is just one huge disappointment - for STAR WARS fans, for Fallen Order fans, for Souls-like fans, and for consumers everywhere. \n\nThis game is a prime example of how far publishers are willing to go to actively sabotage the consumer's enjoyment of a product that they never worked to help create by doing everything they could to make sure it was released in an unfinished, or otherwise un-optimized state for the pursuit of nothing but profits regardless of the measures or means to do so. EA would probably kill younglings if it meant they'd turn a profit. \n\nDo not buy.",

After dropping the $70 for the game, I was forced to download additional software to my PC in order to play the game, in addition to the Origin software I had from previous EA games. You may not think its a bit deal, but this software is by definition malware as its software I did not seek out, it is taxing to my system via background processes and is by design extremely difficult to eliminate. Seriously, check the end user agreement as they even openly state multiple links to various websites, including third party websites, for instructions at only removing part of the software before capping it off by saying that you will still have to eliminate remaining software manually from your local files. This is, frustrating, that a company can get away with such business practices and I have doubts about how legal this practice actually is. However, the damage is done for me at least, but buyer beware. \n\nOh, I am also seeing frame rate drops even in just menus, but the game is otherwise playable in case you were just looking for that.\n\nmal·ware\nnoun\nsoftware that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.",

What is your next move, Jedi?\"[/h1]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor is the third-person action-adventure sequel to the original Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, as it follows the story of Cal Kestis, an orphaned Jedi struggling to survive in an Empire-ruled galaxy that seeks his demise. While toiling with emotions such as love, loss, and rage, he must navigate the complex path before him with the hope, he will not lose himself along the way. Ignite your lightsaber, unholster your blaster and take on the galaxy to prove you are a survivor too.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[th][b]🟩 Positives[/b][/th]\n\t[th][b]🟥 Negatives[/b][/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]🟩 The combat formula has been stunningly improved in nearly every facet to provide a far smoother and more intuitive experience than ever before. The addition of some new stances and skills allows you to customise your combat style in numerous ways giving a greater sense of freedom than ever before.\n\n🟩 Speaking of customisation, you have a plethora of choices in the realm of aesthetic options, from hair and beard styles and attire to lightsaber styles and colours.\n\n🟩 Jedi: Survivor is the most graphically pleasing and ambitious single-player Star Wars game ever created. It is gorgeous in nearly every regard and precisely captures that power experience everyone hopes for with a new Star Wars game.\n\n🟩 On the same spectrum as the visual aesthetics, the audio is simply outstanding. The soundtrack is a perfect combination of both; old and new melodies that harmonise perfectly against the world's atmosphere and overall ambience. All of the above is coupled nicely with the passionate voice-acting team that elevates the experience to the next level.[/td]\n\t[td]🟥 While I didn't experience a lot of technical issues with Jedi: Survivor, I am not without empathy for the large majority who did. The game was and is still riddled with many bugs and infrequent crashing [/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place between Episodes three and four of the movies and five years after the events of Fallen Order. Cal Kestis has come to terms with the events that transpired in the first game, but his crew has split up and gone their separate ways, forcing Cal to seek a new team to take on the Empire. This quickly turns to chaos as the Inquisitors who plagued Cal in the first game continue their hunt for him, and the story begins to unravel from there.\n\nCal begins his journey anew with the hope that he may find some familiar faces as he struggles with both the loss of friends and the anger that burns deeply against the Empire that took them. With his trusty robot companion, BD-1 by his side, Cal must take the fight to the Empire, and discover victory and betrayal along the way.\n\nBut in the end will he stay true to himself and the ways of the Jedi or will he give in to his anger and hate and become the thing he's hated all this time?\n\n[h1]Gameplay Analysis[/h1]\n[b]An elegant weapon for a more civilised age.[/b]\nA large majority of your experience with SWJS will be combat against both weak and formidable foes, so it feels like an apt place to start. The combat here is flawless, the movement is fluid, and the controls are responsive. Each combat stance provides a very different experience as well; dual lightsabers are very fast and powerful but lack defence and range, and double-ended lightsabers, however, are slightly slower and less powerful but deliver a lot more protection.\n\nCombat also consists of force powers. Cal isn't the most force-capable or powerful Jedi to ever exist, he does have access to its potential, allowing him to push and pull enemies, throw his lightsaber and use his unique ability, which lets him slow down time and lets him pick apart enemies.\n\nTo further improve Cal's ability to fight, you are able to spend skill points that you earn from combat and exploration that can vastly change abilities making them more effective in certain situations. You can respec these skills at the cost of skill points, providing some additional freedom in the decisions.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973080301\n\n[b]Do or do not. There is no try.[/b]\nThe planets are substantial in size and provide a lot of scope for exploration and discovery. You won't ever have to go off the beaten path for a story mission, but there are several side missions and events for diligent explorers to uncover. These will often reward you with unique items or a permanent stat boost, making them well worth the time and effort. Exploring the environment will also provide you with more fast-travel locations that make future exploration significantly less tedious.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973080372\n\n[b]Your focus determines your reality.[/b]\nOn top of the already substantial combat and skill choices you can make in the game, you also receive a repertoire of character customisation options that allow you to change the look of Cal and his equipment. These can include hair and beard lengths and styles to the type of clothes he wears and the colours of it and the shape and look of his lightsaber.\n\nThis is where exploration truly takes prominence, as many of the best customisation options are only available through exploration, by finding the scattered rare materials or as items hidden in the deepest, darkest recesses across the worlds.\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual[/h1]\nThe visual aesthetic of SWJS is simply sensational. Never before has a Star Wars game immersed me so perfectly into its world from a visual standpoint than this title did. The environments have been passionately created and developed to be expansive and breathtaking.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2968582682\n\nThis is also true of the soundtrack and overall audio ambience, where every region has its own beautifully developed soundtrack to contrast its environment and aura flawlessly. The voice acting here is probably amongst the best I've experienced in a game to this very day.\n\n[h1]PC Performance and Specifications[/h1]\nWith everything set as high as it goes at 2560 x 1440 resolution, the game ran exceptionally well for the most part. There are a lot of consistent bugs in the game, and it did crash infrequently.\n🟧 Many, many bugs still plague this game.\n🟧 The game crashes infrequently regardless of the graphical settings.\n🟨 The game requires file optimisation every time it launches, which can become tedious.\nRAM: 32GB (Under Load Usage: 40%)\nCPU: i9 10900KA 3.70GHz (Under Load Usage: 53.5%)\nGPU: MSI Ventus RTX 3080 (Under Load Usage: 42%)\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts - Very Good[/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2529084785]Review chart here.[/url]\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor is hands down amongst the best Star Wars games I've ever played. It does so many things exceptionally well and improves upon nearly every facet of the original game. This is all, unfortunately, let down by the poor launch conditions and copious quantities of bugs and glitches still present in the title. This is very likely my GOTY so far, I just wish more players had a better time with it. It’s definitely worth a shot, but it still requires some time in the oven. \n\n[quote]Close your eyes Jedi, and let the force guide you to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/43064204/] Hell, Purgatory and Paradise[/url], where you will begin to understand the true powers of the force.[/quote]",

Unfortunately, there are massive performance issues right now. Its really frustrating why they didn't include DLSS 2/3 as an option for people to use in this game. Nvidia sponsored games most of the time have both FSR and DLSS options. It seems though that AMD will not allow or discourages DLSS to be used in their sponsored games. Completely absurd!\n\nI do recommend this game, as it is really incredible.....but be warned......unless you have a pretty recent gaming computer you are likely to have severe performance issues until this game is fixed.",

Sign up, and enjoy Eorzea today!\n\nJokes aside, it is critically acclaimed for a reason. This game really is what people say it is. All you gotta do is allow yourself to get immersed into this world, just like we used to do when we were kids playing our first MMO's.\n\nThe adventures, the time spent, the friends made along the way, the music, the art, everything. This game has a little thing for every kind of player and whenever you think you got the hang of it, you learn 10 new mechanics that challenge you in awesome ways and keep you engaged.\n\nI never thought I'd have this much fun in an MMO after Maple Story and Archeage, but here I am, 1000 hours in and thirsting for more. Every new content release is a breath of fresh air and the community is simply the greatest I have ever met on the internet. Full of helping hands, curious people, new sprouts (as I once was!) and thrill seekers. Of course there are some bad folks here and there, but c'mon, nothing is perfect. XIV gets close, tho.\n\nIf you are reading this, it means I got your attention with the feelings, and my friend, you're in for quite the ride. Join this world and let yourself enjoy every second of it. Don't rush, don't skip stuff, don't pressure yourself. If you want it to be, it'll be a smooth ride, so ride along.\n\n10/10. No doubt.\n\nPT-BR:\n\nVocê sabia que o criticamente aclamado MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV tem uma Free Trial e inclui A Realm Reborn completo e a premiada expansão Heavensward até o nível 60, sem restrições de tempo de jogo? Inscreva-se e aproveite Eorzea hoje!\n\nBrincadeiras à parte, é aclamado pela crítica por um motivo. Esse jogo é realmente o que as pessoas dizem que é. Tudo o que você precisa fazer é se permitir mergulhar neste mundo, assim como a gente costumava fazer quando era criança jogando nossos primeiros MMOs.\n\nAs aventuras, o tempo gasto, os amigos feitos pelo caminho, a música, a arte, tudo. Este jogo tem uma coisinha pra cada tipo de jogador e sempre que você acha que pegou o jeito, aprende 10 novas mecânicas que te desafiam de maneiras incríveis e o te deixam preso no jogo.\n\nNunca pensei que me divertiria tanto em um MMO depois de Maple Story e Archeage, mas cá estou, 1000 horas depois e sedento por mais. Cada patch novo é um sopro de ar fresco e a comunidade é simplesmente a melhor que já conheci na internet. Cheio de mãos amigas, pessoas curiosas, novos sprouts (como eu já fui!) e caçadores de emoções. Claro que tem gente ruim aqui e ali, mas vamo lá né, nada é perfeito. Mas FF chega perto.\n\nSe você tá lendo isso, significa que chamei sua atenção com os sentimentos e, meu amigo, você tá prestes a pegar a montanha russa. Vem pra esse mundo e se permita aproveitar cada segundo dele. Não se apresse, não pule as coisas, não se pressione. Se você quiser, será um passeio tranquilo, então vamo embarcar nessa.\n\n10/10. Sem dúvida.\n\nTill the sea swallows all!",

            "review": "While this game is capable of being entertaining and mildly interesting in the later sections, the effect is diluted by how long it takes to painstakingly trudge through. Anyone interested in starting out or pulled in by the free trial should be aware that getting to any current content will take months, months you continuously pay for. I went from the middle of ARR to the Endwalker finale in 10 months with a fairly heavy time investment. \n\nThe mantra of FF14 is Waste Your Time, and it shows. There are no puzzles or moments of actual mental engagement to break up the drudgery. You are instructed to go to fixed points in the world, read a conversation. Go to a fixed point, obtain an item, go back and read a conversation. Player input is moving to pre-determined locations and reading unvoiced dialogue. You will be given nonsense tasks at every possible opportunity. Progressing the main quest is like slow-walking through chest-high molasses. Even by the time you're the most recognisable hero on the planet, you will be given menial tasks of no more depth than 'go here, then no back' as a completely undisguised timewasting measure. \n\nThe combat experience is completely inorganic and will have to staring at your enormous hotbar rather than looking at the action onscreen. You'll look at the cooldowns, the enemy's AOE telegraph, your teammates' health. The gameplay experience whittles down to solely the UI and blindness to anything else. You can't dodge, you roll out a rotation, if you're standing in an AOE, you slowly traipse out of it, and the attack animations are not synced with the damage being dealt. If you left the AOE, ran halfway across the arena and are nowhere near the boss, you'll still get hit and die when its attack animation finally plays. It's disjointed and incredibly frustrating. \n\nAll dungeons have the exact same formula. Kill some trash mobs (no skipping), fight a boss, x3. They had to invent bosses with little to no relevance to the dungeon you're in just to fill time, and 7 times out of 10, the final one will be a naked woman.\n\nThe world maps are completely empty and there's no reason to be in them. There are some engaging visuals for sure - cliffscapes marred by frozen crystal explosions, red flowers spearing up through a rainforest, a forest of nothing but purple blossoms. But there are no activities, secrets, or emergent narrative threads present in the open maps. There's no immersive worldbuilding, and no voiced dialogue. You float through them with the background soundtrack and nothing else to tether you to the world. Every time you unlock a new map, you have to complete several quests on foot before you can fly on your mount again.\n\nARR is an absolute slog of bloated old content and masked generic bad guys. It's difficult to retain information about the overarching plot, even if you shotgun the entire storyline all at once, because of the sheer length of time it takes to get through. Heavensward brings in a few interesting aspects and has better characters, but is still paced as slowly as possible. The whole game tends to have a lighting problem that makes everything seem murky. \n\nStormblood is where fun goes to die. The story becomes increasingly realistic in tone, to the point where it barely deserves the title Final 'Fantasy'. At the same time, the plot beats become absurd. You decide to go to the other side of the world, get on a ship, and have to play a whole dungeon about your random ship encounter that has no effect on anything. A woman is revealed to have been her own secret sister for no reason, puts on an overly revealing outfit, and becomes a war general despite not doing anything or having any experience. Everyone celebrates the defeat of the three main villains and none of them have actually died. \n\nThe game is obsessed with pretending a character has died. There are so many fakeout deaths and so few actual losses felt that I ended up maintaining zero sense of suspense about anything. There was no real tension to a potential loss, no reason to ever believe these characters were in danger. The pretense of acting like it will string along the player's disbelief is alike to jingling a set of keys. \n\nAntagonists need to be killed three or four times. Many of them will 'corpse pilot' another dead NPC, so along with trying to focus through the overlong, inexplicably complicated lore, you have to bear in mind which character is ACTUALLY inhabiting the body of another at multiple points. The worldbuilding of this game hinges on the discovery of dynamis, a form of energy generated by Feelings that can change reality, and that is the basis for the plot itself - high emotion, dramatic reveals, cinematic deaths, all underpinned by a vague nonsense that never clarifies. Half the time an important boss fight will occur in space for no real reason. \n\nShadowbringers is a slight turning point where the game earns the right to be a Final Fantasy title. Scenery finally emerges from its boring cocoon of realism. The story unfolds in a satisfying, if formulaic, way.\n\nEndwalker is our fourth foray into a world-ending crisis, and by this point, the tension levels are stale. The characters do attempt to have a little more personality, and this is a thousand hours in. The first half is more of the same heavy, plodding lore dumps. However, the second half suddenly elevates the story to something genuinely exciting and enjoyable. Answers come thick and fast, foreshadowing and reincorporation take the stage, and overall the experience becomes a heady milkshake to sink the mind into. Elpis proves that despite the meandering plot, a kernel of worthwhile fiction could be found, and also that they DO know how to properly light a map so you can see colours. \n\nThe absolutely massive length of time it took to get to those is what keeps me from recommending the game. For most of the playtime, the ascians are hooded, masked, robed, indistinguishable nuisances with no motivation worth opposing. The justification for your heroics exists on the same level as Kingdom Hearts writing - there is Darkness, and that is bad, and we didn't write anything specific. But it's Bad and you are Good, and your are Light, and the Darkness is bad. You're the world's most generic protagonist, prevailing over the Generic Concept Of Bad, being cheered on by thinly-characterised allies who think you'll explode if they don't praise the player roughly every 8 seconds. \n\nThe only reliable thing about the plot is that doesn't care whether it makes sense as long as the effect is dramatic. Zenos sits on his fat ass for an entire expansion, kills *himself*, but doesn't die, and gets his soul back into his body for no given reason I can remember. They constantly invent a strange and flimsy reason why other players arrive to complete dungeons or trials, when this just calls attention to the fact it's nonsensical. A major character gives up his life force to send the player back in time with a dire warning to not change anything, but the player canonically manages to do this again, repeatedly, just to like, mess with stuff. Zenos walked up to your friends during the apocalypse and said 'hey use all your remaining power to send me to the end of the universe so I can kill the protagonist' and, for some reason, they all went 'yeah okay'. Just so that Zenos can usurp the concept of entropy as the entire story's final boss, in spite of him being completely meaningless, a villain for the sake of having one, a guy who just Opposes You because... because. \n\nThere are better games. There are better MMOs. Play this one if you want, sure. I hope you have a great time. Just be aware that they will pad your playtime for as long as possible, leaving you to subsist on breadcrumbs over a year-long endeavor to catch up. If you want to pay for access to this game for that long, go for it. But go for it in full awareness that you'll be committing to a time investment like no other. o7",

The subscription service model works games that are consistently getting free new content, but a game like FF14 that gets full 60$ expansions and still expects its playerbase to pay 12$ per month to play the game is not a healthy or consumer-friendly business model. If you do not have endless money to throw down the Square Enix hole, do not buy this game, you will be unable to play it after a month. There's a free trial that you can play to see if you like the game, but I don't recommend ever buying the full game, and especially not the DLC if you aren't absolutely sure that you'll end up playing the game. I cannot get a refund on the 80$ I've spent on this game in total despite now being unable to play the game for several years and I cannot play the free version because I've purchased the game. \n\nI DO like this game, it's just literally unplayable for me unless I spend an additional 12$ every month. Do not buy this as a new player, get the free trial and play that.",

            "review": "By most metrics the best tab-target MMORPG on the market, but caveat emptor - this is a JRPG with an MMO included, rather than an MMO with the RPG mechanics just tacked-on. It cares about story, character, narrative setup and payoff, is remarkable both in terms of visual style and musical choices, and remains a remarkably earnest product in an otherwise very cynical market. Leave preconceived notions, cynicism and bitterness behind and give it a go honestly and with an open heart and you'll not be disappointed. Go into it with a suspicious and adversarial mindset and you might have a better time elsewhere.\n\nWhile ARR isn't particularly special in terms of storyline and gameplay, virtually everything beyond that - including Heavensward which is a part of the free trial - steps up the quality immensely, leading to an unmissable experience. You owe it to yourself to go through the journey the game places in front of yourself. You will not leave it the same person you went in. I often find that there are two kinds of FFXIV players - ones who never made it past ARR, and the ones who preach the game's virtues from the rooftops like it's the second coming. \n\nYes, it's an amazing game. Yes, you should play it. But it's also a pretty serious commitment. The reason why it isn't for everyone is because not everyone can give it the benefit of the doubt and not everyone can approach an earnest piece of media and let go of all the cynical and adversarial systems that recent gaming has seemed to cling to. \n\nIf you do give it a go, it will reward you. You, the player. The human being who feels sorrow and joy, experiences suffering and triumph, goes through weal and woe. Leave as few barriers between yourself and the things it puts in front of you and you'll be well-treated.\n\nIncidentally, this is just my playtime just since command-lining -issteam stopped working. I used to play it off steam for several years more.",

            "review": "I've been playing Warframe since 2013, and still do today. \nA bad thing about Warframe -> people are lacking creativity. Most of the players seem to play like blind people, since almost every player is focused on ONE thing... Leveling up, and when they've reached the current max lvl they complain about a lack of content and nothing more to do...\nWarframe is a game of customization, filled with opportunities to make every player fit in. Every weapon, Warframe, Archwing etc. can be good. People often seem to think that the prime/stalker weapons are the only thing to use, and that the \"how to mod: ____\" videos on YouTube is the only well working option to make a weapon good. But that is in most cases a big mistake from the players. Sure a starting mk.1 weapon is not as good as the prime one, and of cause there is nothing bad about getting modding inspiration from videos. The thing is, if you put enough effort into a Weapon/Warframe/Archwing/Companion, then that might just work just as good. Why try to make the Ignis good, if you don't like the way it's shooting, why not go for an old school Burston if that's what you prefer?\n\nA lot of people seem to only focus on those things: ranking up and getting good loadouts. It's like people seem to forget what the game is trying to offer you. Try to do something different if you don't like the game. Join a clan, do some Archwing races, finish the quests, challenge yourself like how long can you defend the objective and even better, how long can your squard which you currently are chatting with, having a good time, laughing together about how stupid and yet addorable Clem is, defend the objective!\n\nDon't be a douchebag and join a clan because they've got full research and no taxes. When you join a clan, think of it as you join a community, sure some clans are only out there because of the remaining items they need to reach max lvl.\nDo yourself a favour and look for a clan with a great working community, it doesent have to be a big clan, it can be even more exiting to help a clan grow from the bottom, reqruit players, and experience how a community can be made from a single free to play game.\n\nAnd don't come and say the game is pay to win, because it's not... As they added trading in Warframe, every player is able to get as much platinum as they want. The only thing they can't get without paying is the steam workshop items, and the prime access accessories.... But those are all cosmetics... So let's just forget about the whole P2W thing people are complaining about.",

            "review": "I wanna get a few things off my chest in this review of Warframe, as someone who has been playing for over 550 hours, for those who are new to the game so they don't goof up as much as I did. First off, the game WILL take up space on your computer, so this isn't for the weak ones that crash easily either, and will also take up a portion of your time if you decide to play this.\n\nSecond: this game is not something you can play for 8+ hours straight a day. Unless you have a clear objective of what it is you're gonna do when playing, be it alert missions that crop up with your desired rewards, missions, farming resources and prime items, etc. then you WILL get bored easily. I say this because of the hours I've wasted in indecision of what it is I wanted to do, and its just easier when you plan out what you want to work on.\n\nThird: Be prepared to grind the shit out of the missions when collecting resources or trying to rank up. You will not get far simply blitzing through each mission, and searching areas for much needed loot will help you later. Do not listen to those complaining about not getting enough loot when they go grinding, they make the mistake of speedrunning instead of being meticulous. That said, this leads me to my next point.\n\nFourth: this IS a genuine F2P, and although real currency CAN (not WILL) be used, it is not necessary to advance at all. Using platinum (this is the currency you do exchange your real money into) is completely optional, and there are multiple tips I'll give on the use of it for newcomers: \n1. Spending platinum is optional\n2. don't use it on frivolous things like credits (the game's other currency that you can earn in any mission) or resources as it is NOT WORTH IT IN VALUE\n3. save it for big purchases like colours, hard-to-obtain warframes or accessories. Trust me, you'll want to be stingy\n4. There are ways of gaining plat WITHOUT spending real money, but it does involve grinding specific items and finding willing trading partners. These items are called 'Prime' items, and hold onto as many as possible - you do not want to be selling them for credits even if you cannot use them. Trade them as 'prime junk' with other items to gain platinum, just be patient when looking for partners. \n\nFinally, Each warframe has a set of abilities connected to them that you can use. buttons 1-4 on your keyboard activate them during missions. It took me ages to realise they were even there, so I figured its best to tell you upfront to avoid my ignorance happening to you.\n\nIts entirely up to you on how you play this, and yes there will be tech issues as addressed by other players, but otherwise its a fun way to spend a few hours of your day as well as be a paradise for hoarding and collecting. Or hell for the recovering ones, anyway. In short, good luck grinding the shit out of this game.",

            "review": "Amazing game in my perspective. Not like most other FTP games. There's no paywalls, and almost everything in the game can be earned without paying real $. Hell, you can even get premium currency without paying for it. Just trade with other players! AND there are discounts for the premium currency purchases, up to 75% off. Along with dev-streams which give away the premium currency.\nThe game starts out slow for the first week, due to some timewalls, but nonetheless, it gets very fun after that week (if you work at getting new stuff and doing missions).\nAnd not to mention the updates, the developers are constantly adding new things into the game, all for free. You'll be surprised if you check them out. But be mindfull, the game is a LITTLE buggy at times. But they are never usually game breaking. And if a game breaking problem occurs, the devs will release a hotfix within a day. \n\nOverall, amazing game.",

            "review": "Sigh. I'm no sure why I'm doing this. I usually have an urge to write a short review on this game every few hundred hours I spend in it but usually give up because I get angry at words...Well my inadequacy to accurately portray what I feel about this game.\n\nSeeing that steam shows how many hours I logged on in this game I'm err no stranger to it I suppose. I've been playing this game on and off since around update 7. I started literally on the cusp of closed beta, the week it went into open beta, and fuck me for not logging on that weekend and getting my vandal items (this sort of behavior ends up problematic as you will undoubtedly understand as you read on).\n\nThere isn't really a neutral button for this game. I can't in my right fucking mind recommend this to general public, but obviously there is something to it otherwise I wouldn't have logged few thousand hours into it (its more than what steam says, game had its own thing before steam). Anyway for new players. If you are going in and you aren't very social, you will either get really frustrated with this game, or you will spend more money on it than you could probably find sensible. I've spent a great deal of money on this game, to support it because I felt it was worth it, and I sure as hell got my money's worth, I also get a shiny Excalibur variant people can't get anymore.... That being said, this game is NOT new player friendly. No it isn't eve online level of harsh, but unless you have people helping you a great deal at the start you are going to have a very bad time, unless you absolutely love grinding until your eyeballs bleed out. For majority of established playerbase when new content comes out, it isn't too overwhelming to get it by free means. Even if it is grinding intensive if you stockpiled on something you can sell or trade you can usually acquire it without much fuss. If you are in there with nothing and plan on getting somewhere solo, you are in for a bad day.\n\nDeep breath. Game is complex. You 'can' haphazardly hop in shoot and mod stuff on a whim, but when it comes to the harder content you will end up annoying those who might need you to contribute, or you simply won't be doing the very end content at all. Now even the hardest content in the game is relatively easy, but only when you understand the game mechanics and apply the knowledge accordingly. You might as well bookmark the wiki and have it up on all times fo reference. You will need it, be it too look up damage values, resistances, builds, or find out what drops where. Now here I'm talking high end content. If you are new you have one HELL of a ladder to climb to do it, and most of it will be dumb shit like leveling mods, getting mods, getting mastery rank to be able to equip weapons, and so forth. Usually really tedious crap.\n\nAs a newcommer you have three options. If you plan to trek it solo you can either grind your eyeballs out, and do minimal amount with other people for when you have to (some sorties like interception or so), you can dive in the community and hope to find folks who can help you (plenty of them btw, don't be discouraged), or if you have a friend with an established account have them bring you up to speed. When you have someone to help you, it will save you months of work. I'm not kidding. I gave my friends maxed mods like Serration or Redirection, which to a new player is a damn tall order to have. As well supplied them with spare nightmare/corrupted mods which can take time. Or give them some spare prime set of a warframe I have stocked etc. In short having a friend who is willing to help you bring you up to speed will help with the biggest shortcoming this game has. The eye gouging tedious grind. It's always gonna be there, but thankfully the core game is fun. Shooting shit is awesome, melee mechanics are satisfying as all hell, and when you get your hands on top tier gun (like say Tigris Prime) you will laugh maniacly as you chunk lv 100 assholes by the hundreds and thousands.\n\nSo far I said very little on the actual game itself. In short it is simple. It's mission based co-op game. Each mission is usually randomly generated level with pre-set tiles (like diablo esque games are). With exception of defense type missions, where map is always gonna end up the same with several variants. You either play solo or with up to 4 people(Raid missions are up to 8 people, and are generally pretty fun to play). Enemies are usually plenty, either endlessly spawning, on a timer or numbered. You have one primary weapon,one secondary and melee. Each warframe gets four unique active abilities, and its own stats, bonuses etc. Here you go.It's simple, controls are tight and responsive, guns feel amazing, melee feels amazing, sense of power you can get is overwhelming at times, but you will work to get it. Everything will take time in this game. Learn to try to do multiple things at the same time. If you are farming for something, try to level something at the same time, and so forth.\n\nThis is a free to play title. So question is, is the 'free' part fair. Err yes, and no. For a new player I'd say you have months of work ahead if you wanna be up to speed, or at least on the current edge of things. For current players, absolutely. While DE does do unreasonable crap from time to time, they usually get it right and I don't have *too* many complaints. There are 'timed' exclusive content this game has. Bunch of it usually repeats (eventually), but time windows for some things tend to be tight. So say there is an event at one weekend, and you are too busy geting wasted in Vegas, your options are either trade for the item (and the warframe trading is no simple thing, economy exists in this game like many others like it), or you can hope the item gets reintroduced in the game at a later point. In very rare cases it doesn't (like Excalibur Prime).\n\nIn my case the game caused some compulsive hoarding behavior. New prime frame? I need to have it, because at some point it's gonna be taken out of circulation. New prime weapon? Oh snap it's amazing, I need it? New Stance? New Mods? Next thing I know I'm putting cosmetics on my warframes and playing fashionframe. Every few months I have to stop playing and hold off for a year or so since I feel it might be detrimental to my mental health.\n\nIF you do end up spending money on it. Try to wait for a coupon that you get with daily login rewards. They can go up to 75% (but those are rare). I don't know what steam packages have but I recommend buying PURE platinum from their store. There are very few things platinum can't get you in this game. Anyway with this platinum DO NOT buy shit from the ingame store. Unless it's cosmetics, potatoes or slots. If you need a warframe, or a mod, or whatever, look to trade for it. If you have platinum everyone and their mother will message you for the trade. You can get any prime weapon and frame with platinum (well save for Excalibur Prime and few things that came with that). Some will be very pricey because they have been out of circulation for a long time, but you will find savvy trading with platinum will get you FAR. Another advice, trading to get platinum is also recommended. When you are in position to stockpile stuff (like prime parts or mods), You can trade for platinum and use that platinum to trade for what you want. It ends up being it's own little game within a game.\n\nAnyway, game is free. Check out the gameplay and see if you like it. There is no harm trying it. On the technical end of things, game is sharp and well made. It's fast, responsive and empowering. On mental health side of things, it might be problematic. I come back after a year and the game gives me a sentinel mod for my first Riven mod. Such a nice middle finger welcome back present. I love, it, I hate it, I lose my mind to it.",

I also enjoyed the main story, but it takes a LONG time to slowly playout.  I thought the explanation for just who and what you are was great.\nEarly on I felt like I was not \"getting\" the game and I didn't even know what I wasn't getting.  I saw other players around me, also at level 30, that were doing like 8 times as much damage as me. Then I read about how to double your frame's slots, your weapons slots, get rare mods, get higher tier weapons, and other tricks, all from outside warframe itself.  This game expects you to metagame the hell out of it and play with a wiki page minimized for quick reference.\n\nPros:\n-Its free, at least to begin with. I spend $5 to $10 a month and feel like I have all I need\n-Awesome space ninjas with super powers\n-Cool Weapons. There is little in life more satisfying than cutting you foes in half with a high powered laser.\n\nCons:\n-The game is the grind. You'll see a cool gun, grind for hours or days to get it, play with it for a while, then store if you really like it or sell it if you dont, then rinse and repeat.\n-Little in game explanations. Requires substantial metagaming.",

And when you're not grinding up and down the solar system, you're either waiting for the next thing to grind for, or showing off your fashion prowess. Originally having no story behind it at all, they began putting out questlines and lore, the plotting of which only makes sense if you don't think about it. The game is 90% farming and grinding and the other 10% is waiting even more time to build the things you already spent hours on trying to grind for, any speedy progression requires you to tap into the plague on this game that is microtransactions. On the bright side it is a decent game to kill some time on with your friends, and the whole game itself is worth the price it is offered at.\n\nAll in all 10/10 would grind again. xddddddddd",

Let's say you want to make your warframe like, I dunno, a flesh monster or something, you can do it. Also, you can own a friggin flamethrower that headshots enemies. I KNOW RIGHT? Also, you can now explore 2 new open world levels! They're really fun and I absolutely recommend this game to anyone new to steam or video games.",

We are talking about the \"Update-Hotfix Simulator\" Award and the \"I Love It From The First Day Till This Day\" Award.

Reviews of a game should never be done this far in - you loose perspective.  \n\nSo here you go\n\n1200 hours on record as of writing this. It was good enough for 1200 hours. \n\nYes. I would recomend trying it.\n\nWhy? Because it is free to play, and I got 1200 hours out of it. The math there was pretty easy. Hell I quit playing because I didn't like the direction it was going. I am still going to recomend it - 1200 hours, free to play.\n\nIf you see a review for this game with a thumbs down, and look at that persons time - and it says literally hundreds of hours, and the game is free - Ignore them. It is free to play, and it was good enough for hundreds of hours - unless they have a VERY good reason; It's worth a try.",

But since it is a FREE game I would recommend reading others opinions about it and just read about the game in general to make sure you will like it.\n\nThe game gets constantly updated pretty much which my computer couldn't handle the amount of GB's this game was putting on my computer so I had to uninstall it.\n\nSo I wouldn't really recommend this game just because of how grindy and repetitive it is in general, but my opinions are usually personal so I would check it out and see if the game is for you first before deciding the game is bad because of my poorly written review.",

            "review": "Eat my nuts Ubisoft, you are so grossly disconnected from your community. It is a true shame to watch a game that you enjoyed and loved be slowly butchered by a company that only exists to slowly drain the wallets of their fan base. I sternly believe that Ubisoft purposefully brings out stupid updates and changes to slowly kill the community so that they can let the game die and move on to other projects, while also doing crossover events to steal the money of their dedicated player base. I think ubisoft is just ashamed to come outright and say that they don't want to support or update the game anymore, and just wish to slowly kill the game along with its community.\n\nUbisoft, long ago, ever since they switched dev teams, have lost sight of what siege was supposed to be. Siege is unique, the original path of the game was to have it be a sort of in-between your average arcade shooter and your slow tactical shooters like Ready or Not. However, over the last several years, I feel as though this concept has been lost on Ubisoft, they even try to vilify the part of the community which disagrees by creating the character Deimos. This brings me to the story, why the hell is there one. The lore of the game was that Rainbow Six was a multi-national counter terrorist agency designed to eliminate the most dangerous of terrorist threats. Great, stellar, that is all we needed. Nighthaven was a decent concept, but it was executed so poorly. I think it would have been great to add a PMC group to the team, seems great, but then you give them ungodly advanced levels of technology, rivaling and even surpassing entire nations, that then for some reason creeps into the lore of certain gadgets. It was so unnecessary to do this, I just don't understand why it was done at all. An actual story was and is being developed, and I can't understand why, they bring in a character named Deimos who they say is the villain, yet his only flaw is his moral compass. He is objectively right about rainbow six as a whole, it being a joke and no longer the intimidating counter terrorist organization it once was. Early on in their development of the story, they transition the leader of Rainbow from some lady to some British guy named Harry. This was the start of the fall for siege, as it signified the start of this random ass story building that they wanted to do. \n\nNow a bad story may not necessarily mean the gameplay is bad... except it fucking blows ass. Ubisoft, in the same way they ruin the story, they bring out certain changes to slowly ruin the game. Sledge is a prime example, he was a good operator, in no way broken, he wasn't even very highly picked, yet they took away his smg 11 and made him a 1 armor, and then to add insult to injury they took away his acog later on. What was the point of this, he was never broken or over picked, he was pretty well balanced, and now he is just a worse pick than buck or ash. While not all balance changes are as bad as this, the vast majority of changes that Ubisoft decides to bring out are just bad for balancing. They also have a tendency to nerf things rather than to buff them, or if they do buff operators, they don't make an impactful change. This leads to all ops becoming worse and therefore not as fun, rather than uplifting other ops and making those more fun. The last set of changes have been things such as the UI or kill indicator. They had no reason to change any of these, especially the ubisoft overlay which barely even works and somehow still buggy despite being years after release. The kill indicator is no longer quite as satisfying and snappy as it once was, which makes kills feel less rewarding and not as fun. Continuing, the UI is just a mess. It is confusing, especially for new players, and was so unnecessary. It also plays more into the concept of this game becoming more arcady and \"cartoony\". Lastly, and likely one of the worst changes so far, is the ranked 2.0 system. For some reason, people fail to understand how it works, so the rundown is basically that there are two mmrs that a player has, a hidden and visible, the hidden is what actually pits players against each other, the the visible just exists as its own thing? Like who verified that this was a working system, why in gods name did they try to be innovative on a system that was tried and tested? The hidden mmr system just doesn't seem to work, pitting what would be ranked 1.0 plats against ranked 1.0 champs. Leading to imbalanced, irritating, or boring games, along with poor balancing. The visible mmr also serves no purpose, as it is criminally easy to hit higher ranks, leading to a more than 1000% increase in the amount of Champions. Why does it exist, why are players not given a ranked based off who they play with, why is it based off how well they play against their specific skill level? It leaves no incentives to improve and only the incentive to play and hit champ. The fact that a person with a 12% win loss can hit champ is disgusting. The best of the best of players are the ones meant to be hitting the highest rank in the game, yet for some unholy reason, they just invite morons into the group. If I remember correctly, take this with a pinch of salt, I believe their justification for this was to \"reward players not just based off skill but also how much they play\". They essentially removed the ranked part of the definition of ranked. If I played chess for 16 hours a day for the rest of my life, but remain among the worst players of the game, why in gods name should I be given the title Grandmaster when I would not be able to compete against any other legit Grandmaster? It makes no sense to reward people for play time, and grant them something that they do not deserve. The incentive to play in ranked 1.0 was to improve so that you could hit the higher rank. Without the need to improve, it leaves the community overall worse. Maybe the devs brought it out so they could finally hit a rank past gold.\n\nNo words, not even an entire essay, could describe my dissatisfaction with Ubisoft and how they have handled this game. They have failed the community, the gameplay, and somehow, the core concept of the game itself. It would take an utter buffoon to see what is happening and think to themselves, \"this is perfectly fine\". Take a lesson from any competitive shooter and stop focusing on your casual community. I think the view point of focusing on it to just be completely wrong. While it may bring temporary life into the game, most casual players don't really care about the game and can leave on a whim. Focusing on the ranked community, particularly those at the top bracket to ensure the longevity of a game as those are the people who tend to be the most passionate about the game. Further, the devs of this game either don't really play the game or suck ass at it, so they aren't even good at understanding balance changes. For a lot of games, the devs are actually pretty good at the game, this is because they built the game so they understand it. I would think the devs for Siege, now being the one's making it, would also understand it. Of course not that would be smart and reasonable.\n\nI will sadly, and much to my own chagrin, keep playing the game. This is because there is no other game around like it, and frankly,  this is the only reason the game is still around. Everyone shits on EA for their crappy economy decisions in their games, yet for a lot of the games, they improve and fix this issue, and even in the case of the sports clones, it is easy to just avoid their copys. Just look at battlefront 2, it is a stellar game now but it did release to some controversy. Yet Ubisoft, rather than trying to improve their game, reward the worse parts of the community, and sacrificing everyone who actually cares about the game. They are as arrogant and foolish as Narcissus, since both Ubisoft and he fell in love with themselves.",

            "review": "i have to say, i'm deeply disappointed with the direction rainbow six siege has taken, especially since the release of ela. the game used to rely on strategy, communication, and careful planning. but with ela, the delicate balance that made siege stand out among other shooters has been disturbed, turning it into something more like a standard run-and-gun title.\n\nbut my biggest gripe, the real knife to the heart, is the mishandling of the character \"havoc.\" havoc was teased in the game's e3 trailer, portrayed as this intriguing, menacing character who was supposed to bring an exciting twist to the game. the trailer did an excellent job of building hype around havoc - the character's design, menacing aura, and what appeared to be a unique gameplay mechanic.\n\nthe trailer painted a vivid picture of havoc as a new villain, a ruthless operator, who seemed to be bringing a new level of intensity and danger to siege. it suggested that his arrival would significantly shake up the game's dynamics, posing new challenges and creating fresh strategies for players to explore.\n\nhowever, this was all a pipe dream. despite all the hype, despite all the anticipation built up, havoc is nowhere to be found in the actual game. it's a classic case of false advertising and has left many fans, including me, feeling betrayed. we were promised something exciting, something groundbreaking, but what we got was a no-show.\n\nand if the mishandling of havoc wasn't enough, the writing has also gone down the drain, exemplified by the addition of \"dokkaebi.\" her bio intro is just cringeworthy: \"her fingers dance across the keyboard, the light of the lcd screen underscoring her smirk.\" it's a cheesy line that feels out of place and makes her character feel shallow and uninspired. it's not the level of writing one would expect from a game with the pedigree of rainbow six siege.\n\nit's hard not to feel misled and deceived. the absence of havoc in the game is like a promising movie trailer with no actual film to follow. it's like being served a mouthwatering menu with no food to eat. it's not just about one character - it's about broken promises and shattered expectations.\n\nthe game has deviated from its roots, focusing on quick action and flashy gimmicks rather than on deep, tactical gameplay. the introduction of ela, the misleading portrayal of havoc, and the cringe-worthy writing for dokkaebi have made siege lose its identity, and it's a real shame.\n\nin conclusion, if you loved rainbow six siege for its strategic depth, teamwork, and engaging characters, you might want to give it a miss for now. unless the developers make a U-turn and steer the game back to its roots, it's hard to see this title reclaiming its former glory. so until then, i can't recommend this game.",

            "review": "Yes, I'm giving it a thumbs down after over 3500 hours played. Want to know why?\n\nBecause a game that basically lives or dies on its workshop content should not hit you in a face with a literal spreadsheet every few weeks so you can spend an hour making it work again, and in the process also figure out which of your favorite mods it made obsolete by breaking the backwards compatibility again.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nTo me, over a third of the game's value comes from the workshop - half of it is just extra content, but the other half is quality of life fixes and utilities, many of which are critical to me to properly enjoy the game. And they know it as well - they integrated ideas from mods into the game, they hired modders to be their employees, the mod spotlight is basically using mods as their marketing material. For a project that so desperately relies on the unpaid work of their loving community, they sure have a nasty habit of exploiting that love.\n\nA long time age they started aggresively squeezing the cash out of us with tons of small, simple, and expensive DLCs. Then, a while back, they started using bigger DLCs to regularily break the compatibility of workshop content, effectively discouraging long-term modding projects. And since the remaining modders didn't want to maintain multiple versions of their mods depending on which DLCs you have installed, they just started assuming you have them all, and made their mods require them. Which means that the game effectively started holding the mods hostage until you buy the DLC, indirectly monetizing free content.\n\nAnd then, they announced the sequel.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm excited for the sequel. I hope they will improve the engine so it can get bigger, better, and will allow for even more creative mods. Let them do all the things that this game could not. Honestly, they can release just the engine and the mod support and it would still be a big hit.\n\nBut with a sequel on its way, what's the point of buying this game at this stage? So it can turn into Sims and make you buy all the DLCs a second time for the CS2? So you can get your hopes up and let them disappoint you if it won't work out?\n\nDon't buy this game. Just wait for the sequel. And in case it turns out to be a money-grabbing, buggy, rushed, exploitative trainwreck, aiming for nothing more than finding new ways to abuse and monetize the relations with its community, then you can come back here and try this one instead, because it's definitely worth it.",

It took a while to get the drinks because we're broke af, but hey, I got them few days later after I posted this. We never expected people to interact with this because the idea is just crazy, to our surprise it even exceeded our expectations. I also want to thank everybody for interacting and my friend for keeping his promise, I could never do it without you guys. We will never forget this legendary wholesome moment, maybe when I have the money, I should pay him back with some drinks.\n\n(About the game it's really fun with friends especially when you have a lot of crazy things to do, Los Santos has brought me so many unforgettable memories)",

Sadly, I guess my account got deleted when Kakao finally dipped. \n\nPA looks to be changing things around slowly but surely. Can't find too much p2w aside from needing a tent and horse flute. Maybe fairies if you wan't to play that rng game. But, silver doesn't weigh anything anymore, they give you like 3 pets right off the bat, they give you the ability to have global storage, and even a skill that adds weight. Not to mention seems like they enjoy giving stuff away during events and seasons.\n\nEven if you wanted to buy stuff there are a ton of new player deals that give you a ton of extras for like $5. There are a few recent YT vids explaining how it's less p2w better than I can. Go watch and learn up if you are skeptical. I know i was lol.\n\nDoesn't feel scummy anymore. Just PA trying to improve whats already a great mmo.",

However, it takes a lot of time to really get results and there are a lot of in game purchases that help things go along. I played this game in November 2020 with over 850 hours at the time. I spent upwards of $500 dollars and had numerous characters, billions of dollars, a large collection of items, armor, gear, etc. I'd devoted heavily to the game despite not having much money IRL. I recently returned to this game and found I'd lost all of my account stuff as they had changed companies and deleted everything. I reported this to the customer service requesting some compensation for the loss as I'd been in the process of moving at the time of the transfer and was unaware of losing my account. The customer service basically informed me they wouldn't do anything to help and it was tough luck. I was extremely upset as they could have done something to assist me in restarting. Aside from this incident, the game itself is very fun with constant updates and an active GM staff. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in fast paced combination combat and in-depth life skills. I'd also like to note there is a sequel coming out soon.",

            "review": "I cannot believe I am playing and enjoying an MMORPG in 2023. After years of being totally repelled by anything remotely resembling the genre, I've logged almost 80 hours here and have been having a fantastic time.\n\nThe two things that set Black Desert apart from the rest of the (imo) generic trash out there are:\n\n- (Actual) realtime action combat (this is not FFXIV!), which feels responsive, flexible, and impactful (unlike every other MMO), and...\n\n- Lifeskills, which are what really keep me playing. You can buy property, hire workers, chop down some trees, build a boat, sail the MASSIVE ocean, catch rare fish (or go diving!), fry them up (in a bunch of different ways!), and sell them on the market. All of these steps are supported by numerous, creatively interwoven systems that you are free to engage with, selectively exploit, or ignore entirely, depending on what you want to do.\n\nIf you've ever played an MMO and thought \"what if the fishing minigame was a fishing MEGAgame?\", this is where you belong.\n\nI think I've spent more time gathering, cooking, farming, and messing around with economic systems than I have fighting things, and to be clear, I LOVE fighting things in this game (Maehwa and Corsair main, here). I just can't wait to sail more, upgrade my ship, and really get out there. There is so much to see and do!\n\nAnd what a pleasure it is to SEE - the game is gorgeous. It is a joy to travel around and see the world, with all the different locations, enemies, armor and weapon designs, pets... Of special note is the ocean, with its sparkling waters and ebbing waves. Good stuff.\n\nThere are, of course, some negatives.\n\n- Speaking of travelling the world, there is no fast travel. This will be a negative for some. Personally, I love the immersion that comes from this, and it gives me an excuse to engage with the horse taming/breeding and sailing systems (god, I love sailing), as well as the storage/transportation systems.\n\n- This is the elephant in the room: there is a cash shop, and while it's not P2W, there are certain things that you'd wish the game just... gave you (being able to call your horse from anywhere is one of them), rather than charging you for them. It's not a dealbreaker for me, especially considering there is no subscription fee, and the base price is low.\n\n- Armor/weapon enhancement is done through a roulette system - some people will hate this, but it hasn't impacted me negatively (yet) as there are clever ways around it. I also don't mind a gamble. YMMV.\n\n- Dyes, on the other hand, suffer from an objectively terrible roulette system with no real alternative - buy the palette pack, engage with a pointless roulette and hope you get the right color/style, or... get used to default colors, I guess. This BADLY needs a rework.\n\n- Sadly, you (currently) cannot dye ships, though you can dye wagons and mounts, along with pretty much everything else. I really, really hope the devs do more with ships in the future.\n\n- Let me repair my Epheria Cog, or release an alternative. C'mon. I don't want a big, hulking vessel; let me enjoy my lil speedboat.\n\nTo summarize, if you're sick of garbage combat, unfulfilling lifeskills and economic systems, and P2W nonsense, Black Desert might be your jam.",

Black Desert is a rather complex and involved game in some ways but overly simple with not much depth on the surface. As I once described to a friend, \"it doesn't have much depth, but a LOT of breadth.\"\n\nHowever, recently Pearl Abyss took over international publishing of their own game, removing Kakao Games, which has turned out to be a very good thing. It's taken a while to show, but Pearl Abyss is (albeit slowly) repairing and upgrading their game massively. My TL;DR take is, this is a great time to be a new or returning player to BDO, as (at the time of writing) there's a new area being released within a couple months and a lot of planned upgrades to the core game play, such as the entire original main story quest is supposed to receive actual voice acting and better cut scenes. There's already a sample of this out for the original initial area (Balenos). PA is constantly giving out cash shop items, at least 2 to 3 times more than Kakao ever did. Constant stream of events with actually decent items in them. Decent items in every Season's free rewards. Etc.\n\nNow, to address the elephant in the Lily. Pay to Win. Black Desert has for some time, and still often faces, recurring accusations of pay to win. Now for the purposes of my own review, I am solely going to be dealing with this concept as \"paying for something not available to be acquired in game without a cash purchase and/or providing an advantage exclusively through cash purchase.\" Recently in an argument in the new player group in game, someone brought up an example that when I thought it through, I thought was the PERFECT example despite the fact they used it to prove the opposite point.\n\nTheir example was that: If two players start the game at the same time but one pays cash while the other does not and that cash outlay provides an advantage, that's a problem. Well, actually. *Nerd glasses push.* Here's the problem with that assessment, people paying money into games often do so to compensate for lack of time, so a person paying money might say only play BDO actively for maybe 30 hours a week? Say, 3 hours a day during work days, 7 to 8 hours a day on their day off. This does not include afk times for horse training, fishing, etc. Now let's say the other guy is a hard core gamer with no life. He drops 80 hours active game play a week (again, not including afk timers, we'll just presume both have about equal afk times or neither afks because new and don't know that's a thing).\n\nNow, following my example above and that working person with money has a near infinite bank pool of free cash to spend on the game, he will indeed pull a brief advantage with costume, underwear and tent buffs. Very likely, he'll also buy inventory space, weight limit space and possibly even bank space in a couple of cities. However, presuming they started at the beginning of a season, the gamer will quickly be done with his season before the other guy. He'll be learning about life skilling earlier, how to gain energy and contribution. How to use contribution to expand bank slots. How to do the Magnus quest to gain access to every bank in the game. How to acquire and use workers. Where the best spots are to grind for silver. That he can buy his own costumes off the Central Market. Which quest provides the free tent. That PA will give out undies eventually if he's patient. By end of Season, the gamer will likely have a rather large advantage over his \"p2w\" friend in the ways of knowledge and advancement in the game, not to mention acquiring and having spent his time grinding for the materials he'll need for enhancing his gear up.\n\n\"But Ashi, what about crons? You literally buy costumes for crons & you HAVE to have crons for enhancing your gear!!!!\" They can be bought from a vendor? Sure, it's cheaper if you put a buy order for costumes on the market to get those crons which by implication makes it \"p2w\" because someone has to buy those costumes to fill those orders. I have 3 costume boxes from give away's in my bank I haven't used yet & get literal thousands of crons from just PA give away's, without even going to bosses which literally everyone does. (World Bosses are known for giving out crons). So, why are you complaining about supporting a p2w model that even the whales don't really support much anymore? Go buy them from the vendor or wait for them from the game.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the average player in BDO wants to \"Rush to end game.\" Well, end game started when you turned it on, more or less. Black Desert Online is a Marathon, not a race. There is no \"end of the game\" per se, not really. You can hit a point where progression is pointless, yes. But then new content will come out and change that goal post. Take your time, smell some Silver Azaleas along the way and have fun, it's just a game.",

If you aren't a spending person, there is still stuff to do without paying cash. \n\nFor the others that can buy things and spend on the game there is a ton of stuff to make your playtime better! When you buy things, it's easy to understand even for the less tech savvy people. \n\nThe game has so many places to get answers to your questions regarding quests and things that are game related that makes it more enjoyable as well. \n\nThe general chat is less desirable some hours but gets better as you play. If you don't want to read it you just pop another chat up and you don't see it. \n\nCustomizing your character is out of this world in depth. I was astonished and amazed at how many things you have control over as far as your characters looks. If you don't know what you want, there is something for that too. There's a whole database of previously done character looks to choose from for each type. \n\nThere is a ton of content for every level and play style. If you want to craft you can. If you want to fight things you can. If you want to tame horses you can. If you like farming stuff there's that too. There's something for everyone and every mood. You can also get and decorate your houses. You can have a house in every city. It's neat. \n\nIt was well thought out.

It respects your time and being an action rpg is actually enjoyable to do combat in to. \n\nI am at the 1k hour mark and i returned a month ago, This game constantly has me learning and doing new things, Life skilling is fun for once in a mmo and i can actually play it solo without needing to be carried 24/7 for progress. Everything in BDO IS progress to something. Its very rewarding and very, very fun. \n\nThis game has been simmering and been developed for a long long time, for 10$ its a steal.",

The \"top\" negative review saying its \"pay to win trash\" is a complete clown comment and that person has no idea what they're even talking about lmfao.\n\nSure you can spend money to get things super fast, but you can just legit get everything without spending money. Unless of course you want one of those premium costumes (sometimes you can get them in events) or artisans. You can also craft some costumes too which is better than nothing honestly. Imperial cooking is really profitable I find when you hit Guru boxes.\nThe game is fun to just run around and do quests and kill mobs in my opinion, and if you do spend in pearl shop it helps to pay attention to deals and if they come with coupons to save tons of pearls on purchase.",
